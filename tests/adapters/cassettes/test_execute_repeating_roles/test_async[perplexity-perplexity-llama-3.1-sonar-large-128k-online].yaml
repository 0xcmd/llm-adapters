        term \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting used in many English-speaking contexts.
        Here are some key points about its usage and meaning:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\"
        is an interjection used especially as a greeting, often to people you know
        or in casual settings. It is more informal than \"hello\" and is appropriate
        in most everyday situations, except for very formal occasions.\n\n## Origin\nThe
        word \"hi\" is believed to have originated from a variant of Middle English
        \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention. The first recorded
        use of \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed to a Kansas Native American in the
        1800s.\n\n## Usage\n\"Hi\" can be used in various contexts, such as when meeting
        someone, starting a conversation, or expressing a casual acknowledgment. For
        example, \"Hi, how are you?\" or \"Hi, there!\".\n\n## Other Meanings\nWhile
        \"hi\" is primarily a greeting, it can also be used as an exclamation to call
        attention or, in some dated contexts, to express wonder or derision.\n\nOverall,
        \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used informal greeting in English."}, "delta":
