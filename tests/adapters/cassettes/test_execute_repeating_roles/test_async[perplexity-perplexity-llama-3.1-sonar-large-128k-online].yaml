        for very formal ones.\n\n## Interjection\nIt can also be used as an interjection
        to call attention or express a friendly acknowledgment.\n\n## Other Contexts\n-
        In some contexts, \"hi\" can be an abbreviation for other terms, such as \"high
        intensity\" or \"humidity index\".\n- It is also the name of the U.S. state
        Hawaii when abbreviated as \"HI\".\n\n## Specific Entities\nThere is also
        a Web3 neobank called \"Hi\" which recently announced the cessation of its
        UK operations.\n\nIn general, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used term,
        primarily as a friendly greeting."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":
