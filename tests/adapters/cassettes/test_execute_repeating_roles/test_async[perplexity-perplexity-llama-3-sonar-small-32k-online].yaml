        0, "finish_reason": "stop", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Hi,
        Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings.
        It was released as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" in 1972. The song
        is known for its catchy melody and suggestive lyrics, which were initially
        banned by the BBC for their perceived sexual content. Despite this, the song
        became a staple of Wings'' live performances and was included on several compilation
        albums and reissues.\n\n## Release and Reception\n\nThe single peaked at number
        one in Spain, number five in the UK, and number ten in the US in January 1973.
        It also reached number 18 in Ireland. The song was praised by music critics,
        with *Cash Box* describing it as \"good old rock ''n roll\" and *Record World*
        calling it \"a steady rocker with an infectious chorus and terrific instrumental
        breaks\".\n\n## Ban and Live Performances\n\nThe song was banned by the BBC
        due to its suggestive lyrics, with the BBC assuming that the title phrase
        \"We''re gonna get hi, hi, hi\" referred to drug use. However, Paul McCartney
        later clarified that the correct lyrics were \"get you ready for my polygon,\"
        an abstract image. The song became a popular live performance, with McCartney
        often referencing its ban during concerts and the audience responding positively
        to the mention of its censorship.\n\n## References\n\n-: Wikipedia - \"Hi,
