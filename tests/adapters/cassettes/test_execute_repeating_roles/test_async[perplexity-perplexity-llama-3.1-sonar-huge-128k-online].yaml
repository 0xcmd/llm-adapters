        term \"hi\" can have several meanings depending on the context:\n\n1. **Greeting**:
        \"Hi\" is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence
        or to initiate a conversation. It is more casual than \"hello\" and is widely
        used in everyday interactions.\n\n2. **Other Uses**:\n   - **Music**: \"Hi\"
        can refer to a song title, such as Hannah Diamond''s track \"Hi\".\n   - **Web3
        Neobank**: \"Hi\" is also the name of a Web3 neobank that offers services
        for trading, saving, and spending cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, although
        it has announced the cessation of its UK operations.\n   - **Linguistic Variations**:
        In other languages, \"hi\" can have different meanings, such as in Norwegian
        Nynorsk where it can refer to an animal''s lair, or in Yoruba where it is
        the name of the Latin-script letter H/h.\n\n3. **Etymology**: The word \"hi\"
        originated as a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy\" and has been used
        since the 15th century to attract attention or as a greeting.\n\n4. **Cultural
        References**: \"Hi\" is often used in various contexts, including in literature
        and media, to express friendliness, informality, or to call attention.\n\nIn
        summary, \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual greeting but can also refer
        to specific contexts such as song titles or brand names."}, "delta": {"role":
