        you know what is the capital city of Australia? Yes, I can tell you that the
        capital city of Australia is Canberra. It was established as the national
        capital in 1927. Previously, the largest cities of the country, Sydney and
        Melbourne, each served as a temporary capital after the European colonization
        of Australia, but the two cities were viewed as unsuitable as permanent federal
        capitals due to their overcrowding and strong state pride. Canberra was officially
        chosen in 1908, and its planning and construction have been marked by political
        controversy ever since.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":21,\"completion_tokens\":263,\"total_tokens\":284}}"
