        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting in English. Here are
        some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\" is a friendly,
        casual, and informal way to greet someone upon their arrival. It is more casual
        than \"hello\" and is appropriate in most social settings, except for very
        formal circumstances.\n\n## Etymology\nThe word \"hi\" is believed to have
        originated from Middle English, possibly as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy,\"
        which were used to attract attention. The first recorded use of \"hi\" as
        a greeting dates back to the 19th century, attributed to a Kansas Native American.\n\n##
        Usage\n\"Hi\" can be used in various contexts, such as:\n- A greeting: \"Hi,
        how are you?\"\n- To call attention: Though less common, it can be used to
        get someone''s attention.\n\n## Other Meanings and Uses\nWhile \"hi\" is predominantly
        a greeting, it can also have other meanings or uses in different contexts:\n-
        Abbreviation: \"HI\" can stand for Hawaii, high intensity, or humidity index.\n-
        In other languages: \"Hi\" has different meanings and uses in languages such
        as Cantonese, Norwegian Nynorsk, and Yoruba.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used term for casual greetings in English."}, "delta": {"role":
