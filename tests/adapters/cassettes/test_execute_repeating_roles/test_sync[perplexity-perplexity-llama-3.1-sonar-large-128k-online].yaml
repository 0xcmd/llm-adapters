        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting. Here are some key points
        about its usage and meaning:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\" is an interjection used
        especially as a casual and friendly greeting, often directed towards people
        you know or in informal settings.\n\n## Examples\n- \"Hi, there!\"\n- \"Hi,
        how are you doing?\"\n- \"Hi, Lewis. How are you?\".\n\n## Origin\nThe word
        \"hi\" originally came from attracting attention, possibly as a variant of
        Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy\".\n\n## Other Uses\nWhile its primary use
        is as a greeting, \"hi\" can also be used to call attention or, in some contexts,
        express wonder or derision, although these uses are less common and sometimes
        dated.\n\n## Abbreviations\nIn addition to its use as a greeting, \"HI\" can
        also stand for other things, such as Hawaii, high intensity, or humidity index."},
