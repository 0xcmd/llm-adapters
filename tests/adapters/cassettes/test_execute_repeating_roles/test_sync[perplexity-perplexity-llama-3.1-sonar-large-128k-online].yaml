        Here are some key points about its usage and meaning:\n\n## Interjection\n-
        \"Hi\" is used especially as a greeting, similar to but more casual than \"hello\".\n\n##
        Examples of Use\n- It can be used in various everyday situations, such as
        when meeting someone or acknowledging someone''s presence. For example, \"just
        called to say hi\".\n\n## Etymology\n- The word \"hi\" is believed to have
        originated from Middle English, possibly as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy\".\n\n##
        Formality\n- While \"hi\" is suitable for most casual and semi-formal interactions,
        it is generally not used in very formal circumstances, such as greeting royalty
        or in highly formal events.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and commonly
        used greeting in many English-speaking cultures."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
