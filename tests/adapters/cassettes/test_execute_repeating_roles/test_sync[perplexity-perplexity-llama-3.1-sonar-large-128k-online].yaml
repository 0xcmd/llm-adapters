        term \"hi\" can have several contexts and meanings:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\"
        is a common, casual greeting used to acknowledge someone. It is less formal
        than \"hello\" and is appropriate in most everyday situations.\n\n## Music
        and Media\nIn a different context, \"Hi\" can also refer to a song or music
        video, such as the one by Hannah Diamond, a popstar and image-maker associated
        with the record label PC Music. Her song \"Hi\" was released with an official
        video.\n\n## Abbreviation\n\"HI\" can also be an abbreviation for various
        terms, including \"Hawaii\" (the state), \"high intensity,\" or \"humidity
        index\".\n\nIn general, when used as a greeting, \"hi\" is a friendly and
        informal way to say hello."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
