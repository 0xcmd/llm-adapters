        word \"hi\" is an informal greeting used to attract attention or to greet
        someone in a casual manner. Here are some key points about the term \"hi\":\n\n-
        **Origin**: It is believed to have originated from Middle English \"hey\"
        or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention around the 15th century.\n-
        **Usage**: \"Hi\" is commonly used as a friendly and casual greeting, often
        replacing more formal greetings like \"hello\" in informal settings.\n- **Variations**:
        In some contexts, particularly in Hong Kong Cantonese, \"hi\" can also be
        used as an interjection to express wonder or derision.\n- **Pronunciation**:
        The pronunciation of \"hi\" is /ha\u026a/ in both American and British English.\n-
        **Etymology**: The term has multiple etymological paths, including its use
        as an informal spelling of \"high\" in hyphenated terms and its evolution
        from English \"hi\" to other languages like Cantonese.\n\nFor more specific
        information, you can refer to the sources listed above."}, "delta": {"role":
