        word \"hi\" is a common, casual greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence.
        It is more informal than \"hello\" and is suitable for most everyday interactions,
        except for the most formal occasions, such as meeting the Queen.\n\n### Synonyms\n-
        **Hey**\n- **Hello**\n- **Hiya**\n- **Howdy**\n\n### Usage\n- **Interjection**:
        Used especially as a greeting, as in \"just called to say hi\".\n- **Cultural

        says \"hi\" when passing each other on the street.\n\n### Examples\n- \"Just
        called to say hi\" (example from Merriam-Webster).\n- \"When you walk down
        the street in a small town, it might seem like everyone you pass says ''hi''\"
        (example from Vocabulary.com).\n\n### Additional Information\n- The term \"hi\"
        has been in use since the 1800s, attributed to a Kansas Native American.\n-
        It is also used in other contexts, such as \"hi\" referring to the state of
        Hawaii or \"hi\" meaning high intensity or humidity index, though these are
        less common uses."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
