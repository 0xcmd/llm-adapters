        word \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s
        presence or to initiate a conversation. It is generally more casual than \"hello\"
        and is suitable for most social interactions except for the most formal circumstances,
        such as meeting the Queen.\n\n### Etymology\nThe term \"hi\" originated from
        Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention. Over
        time, it evolved into a friendly and casual greeting.\n\n### Usage\n- **Interjection**:
        \"Hi\" is used as a greeting, often to express friendliness or familiarity.
        For example, \"Just called to say hi\".\n- **Variations**: Other variations
        of \"hi\" include \"hey,\" \"hello,\" \"hiya,\" and \"howdy,\" but \"hi\"
        remains the most commonly used.\n- **Cultural References**: The term has been
        used in various contexts, including music (e.g., Hannah Diamond''s song \"Hi\")
        and technology (e.g., the crypto neobank Hi.com).\n\n### Pronunciation\nThe
        pronunciation of \"hi\" can vary depending on the context and regional dialect.
        For example, in Cantonese, it is pronounced as \"haai\" (haai 1)."}, "delta":
