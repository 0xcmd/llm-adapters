        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual greeting, similar to \"hello\" but
        less formal. Here are some key points about its usage and meaning:\n\n1. **Casual
        Greeting**: \"Hi\" is a common, informal way to greet someone, especially
        in everyday conversations and among friends or acquaintances.\n\n2. **Usage**:
        It can be used in various contexts, such as saying \"hi\" to someone you pass
        on the street, in a phone call, or in written messages like emails or text
        messages.\n\n3. **Etymology**: The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated
        in the 1800s, possibly from a Kansas Native American source, and is related
        to other greetings like \"hey\" and \"hello\".\n\n4. **Examples**: It can
        be used in simple greetings (\"Hi, how are you?\"), in casual conversations
        (\"Hi, there\"), or even in written messages (\"Love from Sophie. PS Say hi
        to Gemma\").\n\n5. **Other Meanings**: In specific contexts, \"hi\" can also
        refer to other things, such as \"high intensity\" or \"humidity index,\" but
        these are less common and context-dependent.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used greeting that is appropriate in most informal situations."},
