        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting, often to people you
        know. Here are some key points about its usage and meaning:\n\n1. **Greeting**:
        \"Hi\" is a casual way to greet someone, especially in informal settings.
        It is commonly used in everyday conversations and is less formal than \"hello\".\n\n2.
        **Usage Examples**:\n   - It can be used as a standalone greeting: \"Hi, there!\"
        or \"Hi, how are you doing?\".\n   - It can also be used in written communications,
        such as in emails or text messages: \"Love from Sophie. PS Say hi to Gemma\".\n\n3.
        **Etymology**: The word \"hi\" originally comes from Middle English \"hey\"
        or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention. Over time, it evolved into
        a friendly, informal greeting.\n\n4. **Other Meanings**: While \"hi\" is primarily
        a greeting, it can also be used in other contexts, such as in hyphenated terms
        to mean \"high\" (e.g., \"hi-quality videos\").\n\n5. **Cultural Usage**:
        \"Hi\" is widely used in many cultures and languages, often borrowed from
        English. For example, in Hong Kong Cantonese, \"hi\" is used as a greeting
        similar to its English counterpart.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile and
        widely used greeting that is appropriate in most informal situations."}, "delta":
