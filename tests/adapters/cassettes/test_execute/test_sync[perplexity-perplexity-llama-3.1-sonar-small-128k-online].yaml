        term \"hi\" is a common greeting, more casual than \"hello.\" It is used especially
        as a friendly or informal way to acknowledge someone, and it is appropriate
        in most social settings except for the most formal circumstances.\n\n### Usage
        Examples\n- **Casual Greeting**: \"Just called to say hi.\"\n- **Informal
        Setting**: \"Hi, how are you?\"\n\n### Variations\n- **Synonyms**: Other common
        greetings include \"hello,\" \"hey,\" \"hiya,\" and \"howdy\".\n- **Formal
        Context**: It is generally not suitable to say \"hi\" to someone like the
        Queen in a formal setting.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n- **Origin**: The
        term \"hi\" has its roots in American culture, with the first recorded use
        attributed to a Kansas Native American in the 1800s.\n\n### Additional Context\n-
        **Music**: The term \"hi\" is also used in song titles and lyrics, such as
        in Hannah Diamond''s song \"Hi,\" which features a pop and electronic music
        style.\n- **Travel**: In the context of travel, \"hi\" might be used in a
        hostel setting, such as in HI USA hostels, where staff and volunteers use
        insider tips to help guests live like locals."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
