        word \"hi\" is an informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence,
        particularly in casual or familiar settings. Here are the key points about
        \"hi\" from various sources:\n\n- **Definition**: An interjection used especially
        as a greeting, similar to \"hello\" but more casual.\n- **Etymology**: Originates
        from Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention.\n-
        **Usage**: Commonly used in everyday conversations, especially in informal
        settings. It is appropriate in most social interactions except for the most
        formal circumstances.\n- **Examples**: \"Just called to say hi,\" \"Hi, Dior,
        Nars\u2014the retailer reliably satisfies our cravings for all things beauty,\"
        and \"Being online can be impersonal, so when shooting your shot on a dating
        app, give more than a simple hey/hi\".\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used greeting that is suitable for most social interactions."},
