        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a greeting and has several other meanings
        and uses:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\" is a common, informal greeting, often used
        to acknowledge someone''s presence or to initiate a conversation. It is more
        casual than \"hello\" and suitable for most everyday interactions, except
        in very formal settings.\n\n## Other Meanings\n- \"Hi\" can also be an exclamation
        to call attention or express wonder or derision, although these uses are less
        common.\n- It is an abbreviation for several terms, including \"Hawaii,\"
        \"high intensity,\" and \"humidity index\".\n\n## Etymology\nThe word \"hi\"
        is believed to have originated as a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\"
        used to attract attention, dating back to around 1475.\n\n## Usage in Sentences\nExamples
        of using \"hi\" in sentences include:\n- \"Just called to say hi.\"\n- \"Stop
        by to say hi and get your book signed.\"\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used term, primarily serving as a friendly and informal greeting."},
