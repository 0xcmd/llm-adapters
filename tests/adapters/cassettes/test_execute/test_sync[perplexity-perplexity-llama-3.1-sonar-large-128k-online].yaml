        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual and informal greeting. Here are
        some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n## Usage\n- \"Hi\" is a common,
        friendly greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence, especially in informal
        settings. It is less formal than \"hello\" and can be used in a variety of
        situations, such as when meeting someone on the street or starting a conversation.\n\n##
        Examples\n- It can be used in various contexts, such as \"Hi, how are you?\"
        or \"Hi, there!\".\n\n## Origins\n- The origin of \"hi\" is attributed to
        the 19th century, with one of the earliest mentions linked to a Kansas Native
        American. It is also considered a variant of Middle English words like \"hey\"
        and \"hy\".\n\n## Other Uses\n- While primarily a greeting, \"hi\" can also
        be used to call attention or express surprise, though these uses are less
        common.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used greeting that is
        appropriate in most casual and informal interactions."}, "delta": {"role":
