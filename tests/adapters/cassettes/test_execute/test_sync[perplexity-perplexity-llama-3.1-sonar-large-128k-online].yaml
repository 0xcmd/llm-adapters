        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting in English. Here are
        some key points about its usage and meaning:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\" is a common,
        casual greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence, especially among
        people you know. It is less formal than \"hello\" and suitable for most everyday
        interactions.\n\n## Pronunciation and Usage\nIt is pronounced as /ha\u026a/
        in both US and UK English. Examples of its use include \"Hi, there!\", \"Hi,
        how are you doing?\", and \"Just called to say hi\".\n\n## Other Meanings
        and Uses\nWhile \"hi\" is mainly an interjection for greeting, it can also
        be used in other contexts:\n- As an exclamation to call attention.\n- In some
        dated contexts, it can express wonder or derision.\n\n## Abbreviations\n\"Hi\"
        can also be an abbreviation for other terms, such as Hawaii, high intensity,
        or humidity index.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used informal
        greeting in English."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
