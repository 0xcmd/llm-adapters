        a Greeting\n\"Hi\" is commonly used as an informal greeting, especially among
        people who know each other. It is more casual than \"hello\" and is appropriate
        in most social situations, except for very formal ones.\n\n## Abbreviation\n\"Hi\"
        can also be an abbreviation for several terms, including:\n- Hawaii, the U.S.
        state.\n- High intensity, often used in contexts like exercise or technology.\n-
        Humidity index, a measure of the heat index due to humidity.\n\n## Other Uses\nIn
        some contexts, \"hi\" can be used as an exclamation to call attention or express
        wonder or derision, although these uses are less common.\n\nOverall, the most
        frequent and widely recognized use of \"hi\" is as a friendly and informal
        greeting."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
