        word \"hi\" is an informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence
        or to initiate a conversation. It is more casual than \"hello\" and is commonly
        used in everyday interactions, especially among friends or people who know
        each other.\n\n### Etymology\nThe term \"hi\" originated from a variant of
        Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention. It
        has since become a widely recognized and versatile greeting suitable for various
        contexts.\n\n### Usage\n- **Greeting**: \"Hi\" is often used as a friendly
        and casual way to greet someone, such as \"Hi, there!\" or \"Hi, how are you?\".\n-
        **Informal**: It is generally used in informal settings, making it less suitable
        for very formal occasions.\n- **Cultural Variations**: The pronunciation and
        usage of \"hi\" can vary across different cultures and regions. For example,
        in Hong Kong Cantonese, \"hi\" is pronounced as \"haai\" and has different
        connotations and uses.\n\n### Examples\n- \"Just called to say hi.\"\n- \"Stop
        by to say hi, get your book signed, buy a book or meet Curly Girl, the bartender.\"\n-
        \"Being online can be impersonal, so when shooting your shot on a dating app,
        give more than a simple hey/hi.\"\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile and
        widely used greeting that is perfect for casual interactions."}, "delta":
