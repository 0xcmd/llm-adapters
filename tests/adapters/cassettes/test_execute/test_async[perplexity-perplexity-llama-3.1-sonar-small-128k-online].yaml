        word \"hi\" is an interjection used as a casual greeting, more informal than
        \"hello.\" It is commonly used in everyday conversations to acknowledge someone''s
        presence or to initiate a conversation. Here are some key points about \"hi\"
        from the sources:\n\n- **Definition**: \"Hi\" is used especially as a greeting,
        making it a versatile and widely accepted way to start an interaction.\n-
        **Examples**: It can be used in various contexts, such as saying \"just called
        to say hi\" or mentioning it in sentences like \"Don''t go up and say hi\u2014your
        friend would be mortified\".\n- **Formality**: While \"hi\" is generally appropriate
        in most social situations, it might not be suitable for very formal occasions,
        such as meeting the Queen.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a fundamental part of everyday
        communication, serving as a friendly and casual way to connect with others."},
