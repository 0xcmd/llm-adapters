        Yes, I can help with your request. Here is a summary of what you asked:\\n\\nYou
        are looking for a recipe for baking a lemon pound cake from scratch that is
        fluffy and moist. You also mentioned that you would like the recipe to yield
        a single 1-pound loaf.\\n\\nBased on your request, I have found a recipe for
        a lemon pound cake that should meet your needs. Here are the ingredients and
        steps you'll need to follow:\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose
        flour\\n* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder\\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\\n* 1 cup granulated
        sugar\\n* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature\\n* 3 large eggs, at
        room temperature\\n* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\\n* 1/4 cup freshly
        squeezed lemon juice\\n* Zest of 1 lemon\\n* 1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature\\n*
        1 tablespoon vegetable oil\\n\\nFor the lemon syrup:\\n\\n* 1/4 cup granulated
        sugar\\n* 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice\\n\\nFor the lemon glaze:\\n\\n*
        1 cup confectioners' sugar\\n* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice\\n\\nSteps:\\n\\n1.
        Preheat your oven to 325\xB0F/165\xB0C. Line a 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.75-inch (21.5
        x 11.5 x 7 cm) loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the long
        sides. Set aside.\\n2. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour,
        baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\\n3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted
        with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl using a hand mixer,
        cream together the sugar and butter on medium-high speed until light and fluffy,
        about 5 minutes.\\n4. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each
        addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla
        extract.\\n5. In a small bowl, mix together the lemon juice and zest.\\n6.
        With the mixer on low speed, alternate adding the flour mixture and the milk
        to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the flour. Mix until just
        combined.\\n7. Gently fold in the vegetable oil with a rubber spatula. Be
        careful not to overmix.\\n8. Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan,
        smoothing the surface with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon.\\n9.
        Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the
        cake comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs attached.\\n10. While the
        cake is baking, make the lemon syrup by combining the sugar and lemon juice
        in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the
        sugar has completely dissolved. Remove from heat and set aside.\\n11. Once
        the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about
        10 minutes. Then, using the parchment paper overhang, lift the cake out of
        the pan and place it on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet.\\n12.
        While the cake is still warm, use a toothpick to poke holes all over the surface.
        Slowly spoon the lemon syrup over the top, allowing it to soak into the cake.\\n13.
        Allow the cake to cool completely on the wire rack.\\n14. Once the cake is
        cool, make the lemon glaze by whisking together the confectioners' sugar and
        lemon juice in a small bowl. Drizzle the glaze over the top of the cake, allowing
        it to drip down the sides.\\n\\nYour lemon pound cake is now ready to serve!
        Enjoy!\\n\\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, please let
