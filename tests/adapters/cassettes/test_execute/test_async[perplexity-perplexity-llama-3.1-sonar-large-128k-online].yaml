        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a greeting or interjection. Here are the
        key points about its usage and origins:\n\n## As a Greeting\n- \"Hi\" is a
        friendly, informal, and casual greeting used upon someone''s arrival. It is
        more casual than \"hello\" and is appropriate in most but not the most formal
        circumstances.\n\n## Etymology\n- The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated
        from Middle English, possibly as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy\" around the
        15th century.\n\n## Other Uses\n- Besides being a greeting, \"hi\" can also
        be used as an exclamation to call attention.\n- In some contexts, it has been
        used to express wonder or derision, although this usage is dated.\n\n## Examples\n-
        It is commonly used in everyday conversations, such as saying \"just called
        to say hi\".\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used informal
        greeting that has been part of English language usage for several centuries."},
