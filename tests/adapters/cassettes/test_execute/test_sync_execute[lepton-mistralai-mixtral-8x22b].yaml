        AI model Differences between traditional physics engines and AI-enhanced physics
        engines in virtual environments.\n\n**Prompt:** Differences between traditional
        physics engines and AI-enhanced physics engines in virtual environments.\n\n**The
        response should be:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various
        domains, including physics engines for virtual environments. Let me outline
        the differences between traditional physics engines and AI-enhanced physics
        engines, which can help you to better understand their capabilities:\n\n1.
        Understanding of the environment:\n   - Traditional physics engines: They
        only rely on predefined variables and rules to simulate physical interactions.\n   -
        AI-enhanced physics engines: They continuously learn from the environment
        through reinforcement learning, neuroevolution, or another learning method,
        which often leads to more realistic outcomes.\n\n2. Flexibility and dynamism:\n   -
        Traditional physics engines: They are limited to interactions programmed by
        developers based on predefined rules or assumptions.\n   - AI-enhanced physics
        engines: They can interpret complex","tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"length"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":6,"total_tokens":262,"completion_tokens":256}}'
