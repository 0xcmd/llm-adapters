        How can I help you today? I''m here to answer any questions you might have.\n\nRegarding
        your previous question, it seems that you were asking for a Python code snippet
        to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a certain limit. Here''s an example of
        how you might write that in Python:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(limit):\n   a,
        b = 0, 1\n   while a <= limit:\n      print(a)\n      a, b = b, a + b\n\n#
        Call the function with a limit of 10\nfibonacci(10)\n```\n\nThis code defines
        a function called `fibonacci` that takes a single argument, `limit`. It initializes
        two variables, `a` and `b`, to 0 and 1, respectively. It then enters a `while`
        loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to the given limit.
        In each iteration of the loop, it prints the value of `a`, then updates the
        values of `a` and `b` to be the previous two values, in that order. So `a`
        always holds the previous number, and `b` holds the current number. When the
        loop exits, `a` will be the last number printed, which is the next number
        in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any
        other questions.","name":null,"tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":20,"total_tokens":333,"completion_tokens":313,"estimated_cost":2.331e-05}}'
