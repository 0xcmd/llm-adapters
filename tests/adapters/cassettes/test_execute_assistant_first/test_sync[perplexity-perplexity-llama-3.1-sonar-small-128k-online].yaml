        word \"hi\" is a common, casual greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence
        or to initiate a conversation. It is generally more informal than \"hello\"
        and is suitable for most everyday interactions, except for the most formal
        occasions.\n\n### Definition and Usage\n- **Interjection**: \"Hi\" is used
        especially as a greeting to express friendliness and informality.\n- **Origin**:
        The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated from a variant of Middle English
        \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention.\n\n### Examples\n-
        **Casual Greeting**: \"Hi, how are you?\"\n- **Informal Setting**: \"Hi, Dior,
        Nars\u2014the retailer reliably satisfies our cravings for all things beauty\".\n-
        **Friendly Interaction**: \"Being online can be impersonal, so when shooting
        your shot on a dating app, give more than a simple hey/hi\".\n\n### Variations\n-
        **Regional Variations**: In some regions, particularly in Hawaii, \"hi\" can
        also refer to the state of Hawaii or be used in other contexts like \"high
        intensity\" or \"humidity index\".\n- **Cultural Contexts**: In Hong Kong
        Cantonese, \"hi\" can be used as an interjection similar to \"hello,\" and
        it has other meanings in different cultural contexts.\n\n### Practical Usage\n-
        **Formal vs. Informal**: While \"hi\" is suitable for most everyday interactions,
        it is not recommended for very formal settings, such as meeting the Queen.\n-
        **Cross-Cultural Experiences**: The word \"hi\" can facilitate cross-cultural
        interactions and is widely recognized across different cultures."}, "delta":
