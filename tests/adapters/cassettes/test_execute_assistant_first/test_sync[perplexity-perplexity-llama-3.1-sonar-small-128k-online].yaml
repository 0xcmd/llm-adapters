        word \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s
        presence or to initiate a conversation. It is generally more casual than \"hello\"
        and is suitable for most social interactions, except in very formal settings.\n\n###
        Etymology\nThe term \"hi\" is believed to have originated from Middle English
        \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention around the 15th century.\n\n###
        Usage\n- **Greeting**: \"Hi\" is often used as a friendly and casual way to
        greet someone, such as when meeting a friend or acquaintance.\n- **Interjection**:
        It can also be used to call attention or express surprise, similar to \"hey\"
        or \"hello\".\n- **Variations**: Other variations include \"hiya,\" \"hey,\"
        and \"howdy,\" but \"hi\" remains one of the most commonly used greetings.\n\n###
        Cultural References\n- **Music**: There is a song titled \"Hi\" by Hannah
        Diamond, which features a pop and electronic music style.\n- **Technology**:
        The term \"hi\" is also used in various digital contexts, such as in online
        greetings or as part of a company name like \"hi.com,\" which offers cryptocurrency
        and fiat currency services.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely
        used greeting that is appropriate in most social situations."}, "delta": {"role":
