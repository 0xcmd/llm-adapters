        and giving opportunities for students to share their ideas.\n4. Foster a sense

        projects, and other collaborative activities. This helps students feel connected
        and motivated to participate.\n5. Provide feedback: Provide timely and constructive

        can access it from anywhere, at any time.\n9. Allow multiple ways to engage:

        reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, or participating in discussions.\n10.
