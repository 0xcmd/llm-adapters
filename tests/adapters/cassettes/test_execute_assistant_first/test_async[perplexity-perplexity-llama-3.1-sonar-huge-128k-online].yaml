        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual greeting, similar to \"hello\" but
        more informal. Here are some key points about \"hi\":\n\n1. **Greeting**:
        \"Hi\" is used to greet someone in a friendly and informal manner. It is appropriate
        in most social situations except for very formal ones.\n\n2. **Etymology**:
        The word \"hi\" originated as a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\"
        used to attract attention or as an exclamation.\n\n3. **Usage**: \"Hi\" can
        be used in various contexts, such as in person, over the phone, or in written
        communication like emails or text messages. It is often used in casual settings
        and is a common way to start a conversation.\n\n4. **Other Meanings**: \"Hi\"
        can also stand for other terms, such as \"high intensity\" or \"humidity index,\"
        but these are less common and context-dependent.\n\n5. **Cultural References**:
        \"Hi\" has been used in various cultural contexts, including music, as seen
        in the song \"Hi\" by Hannah Diamond.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used greeting that is suitable for most informal interactions."},
