        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual and friendly greeting. Here are
        some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n## Usage\n- \"Hi\" is an interjection
        used especially as a greeting, which is more casual than \"hello\".\n- It
        is appropriate in most informal settings but should be avoided in very formal
        circumstances.\n\n## Origins\n- The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated
        from a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which dates back to around
        1475. It was also used to attract attention.\n\n## Examples\n- It can be used
        in various contexts, such as saying \"just called to say hi\" or as an exclamation
        to call attention.\n\n## Other Uses\n- While \"hi\" is predominantly an interjection,
        it can also be used in other contexts, such as in abbreviations (e.g., Hawaii,
        high intensity) or in informal spellings (e.g., \"hi-\" as in \"hi-quality\").\n\nOverall,
        \"hi\" is a versatile and commonly used greeting in everyday language."},
