        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting in English. Here are
        some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n## Usage\n- \"Hi\" is a friendly,
        casual greeting used upon someone''s arrival or to get someone''s attention.\n-
        It is more informal than \"hello\" and suitable for most social interactions,
        except in very formal settings.\n\n## Origins\n- The word \"hi\" is believed
        to be a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which dates back to around
        1475.\n\n## Other Uses\n- Besides being a greeting, \"hi\" can also be used
        as an exclamation to call attention or, in some dated contexts, to express
        wonder or derision.\n\n## Abbreviations\n- \"Hi\" can also be an abbreviation
        for other terms, such as \"Hawaii,\" \"high intensity,\" or \"humidity index,\"
        though these are less common uses of the term.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a widely
        recognized and commonly used greeting in everyday English."}, "delta": {"role":
