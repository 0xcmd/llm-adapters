        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual and friendly greeting. Here are
        some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n## Usage\n- \"Hi\" is an interjection
        used especially as a greeting, which is more casual than \"hello\".\n- It
        is appropriate in most informal settings but should be avoided in very formal
        circumstances.\n\n## Origins\n- The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated
        from a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which dates back to around
        1475.\n\n## Examples\n- It can be used in various contexts, such as saying
        \"hi\" to someone upon their arrival or to attract attention.\n\n## Other
        Meanings\n- While \"hi\" is predominantly a greeting, it can also be used
        in other contexts, such as expressing wonder or derision, though these uses
        are less common and somewhat dated.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and
        widely used greeting that is suitable for most everyday interactions."}, "delta":
