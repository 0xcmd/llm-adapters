        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting, particularly in English.\n\n##
        Definition\n- It is an interjection used especially as a greeting, which is
        more casual than \"hello\".\n\n## Usage\n- You can use \"hi\" to greet people
        you know, such as saying \"Hi, there!\" or \"Hi, how are you doing?\".\n-
        It is appropriate in most social situations, except for very formal circumstances.\n\n##
        Origin\n- The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated from a variant of
        Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" and it was first mentioned in the context
        of a Kansas Native American in the 1800s.\n\n## Examples\n- \"Hi, Lewis. How
        are you?\"\n- \"Just called to say hi.\"\n- \"Oh hi, Ben.\"\n\nIn summary,
        \"hi\" is a common, friendly, and informal way to greet someone."}, "delta":
