        used as an informal greeting, similar to \"hello\" or \"hey\".\n2. **Abbreviation**:
        It can be an abbreviation for \"Hawaii\" or \"high intensity\".\n3. **Company

        save, and spend cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. However, the UK operations
        of this company have been ceased, and users are required to transfer their
        assets by specific dates to avoid fees.\n4. **Music**: \"Hi\" is the title
        of a song by Hannah Diamond, a popstar and professional image-maker known
        for her work with the record label PC Music.\n\nThese different uses highlight
        the versatility of the term \"hi\" in various contexts."}, "delta": {"role":
