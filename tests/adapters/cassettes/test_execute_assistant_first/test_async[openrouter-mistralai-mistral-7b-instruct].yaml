        Hello! How can I help you today? If you have any questions about the AI field,
        programming, or any other topic, feel free to ask.\\n\\nManual for AVL Tree:\\n\\nA
        self-balancing binary search tree, the AVL tree is a popular data structure
        used for quick lookups in sorted data sets, particularly for maintaining sorted
        lists in algorithms. Named after its inventors, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and
        Evgenii Landis, the AVL tree employs a balance factor to maintain balance,
        in addition to the standard left and right child trees.\\n\\nHere's a basic
        structure of an AVL tree:\\n```typescript\\nclass Node {\\n    key: number;\\n
        \   height: number;\\n    balanceFactor: number;\\n    leftChild: Node;\\n
        \   rightChild: Node;\\n    parent: Node;\\n\\n    constructor(key: number,
        parent: Node = null) {\\n        this.key = key;\\n        this.height = 1;\\n
        \       this.balanceFactor = 0;\\n        this.leftChild = null;\\n        this.rightChild
        = null;\\n        this.parent = parent;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n1. Rotation:
        To maintain the balance, an AVL tree performs rotations when there are imbalances
        that exceed the threshold (a balance factor of 2 or -2). The two types of
        rotations for an AVL tree are left rotation and right rotation:\\n\\n- Left
        rotation:\\n```scss\\n                 A\\n               /    \\\\\\n              B
        \      C\\n             / \\\\     / \\\\\\n            D   E   F   G\\n         RIGHT
        RIGHT LEFT\\n\\n          A\\n        /    \\\\\\n       B      C\\n     LEFT
        \    RIGHT\\n       A      B\\n      /   \\\\\\n     D     E\\n```\\n\\n-
        Right rotation:\\n```scss\\n                   A\\n                 /     \\\\\\n
        \               B          C\\n               / \\\\       / \\\\\\n              D
        \  F        G   H\\n             /             /   \\\\\\n            E              I
        \    J\\n             LEFT            RIGHT\\n        LEFT           RIGHT\\n
        \      B                   C\\n      / \\\\\\n     D   E\\n```\\n\\n2. Reworking
        balance factor: After each rotation, update the balance factors and the heights
        of the nodes involved in the rotation to maintain balance.\\n\\n3. Re-balancing:
        When adding or removing a node, check the height differences between the subtrees
        of the current node. Calculate the balance factor for the current node and
        re-balance the tree if the balance factor exceeds the threshold of 2 or -2.\\n\\n-
        Adding a node: If a node is added as a leaf, there might be an imbalance,
        so a rotation might be necessary.\\n\\nStart by calculating the balance factors
        for the parent and current node. If the node has a balance factor of -2 or
        2, it is considered imbalanced.\\n\\nCheck the height difference between the
        subtrees:\\n  - If the left subtree has a height difference of 2, perform
        a RIGHT rotation on the left child, and then a LEFT rotation on the current
        parent node.\\n  - If the right subtree has a height difference of 2, perform
        a LEFT rotation on the right child, and then a RIGHT rotation on the current
        parent node.\\n\\nRe-calculate the balance factors and heights after the rotation,
        and repeat the process if the balance factor is still outside the threshold.\\n\\n-
        Removing a node: Removing a node is more complicated in the AVL tree because
        we must maintain balance in the tree. The process involves finding a suitable
        replacement node, such as a successor or min node, to replace the node being
        removed and then re-balancing the tree.\\n\\nFor further understanding, the
        complete implementation of an AVL tree can be found online under various programming
        languages, such as Java, C++, or Python.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"eos\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":12,\"completion_tokens\":874,\"total_tokens\":886}}"
