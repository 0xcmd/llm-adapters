        How can I help you today? If you have any questions or need assistance with
        something, feel free to ask. I''m here to help!\n\nIn the meantime, here''s
        a fun and interesting fact for you:\n\nDid you know that octopuses have three
        hearts? Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest
        of the body. When an octopus swims, the heart that delivers blood to the organs
        stops beating, which is why octopuses prefer to crawl rather than swim, swimming
        exhausts them."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"total_tokens":143,"completion_tokens":124}}'
