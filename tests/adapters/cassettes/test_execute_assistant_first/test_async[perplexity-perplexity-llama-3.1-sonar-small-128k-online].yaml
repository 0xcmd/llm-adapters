        term \"hi\" is an informal and casual greeting used to acknowledge someone''s
        presence or arrival. It is commonly used in various contexts, including in
        person, over the phone, or in digital communication.\n\n### Etymology\nThe
        word \"hi\" originated from Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used
        to attract attention.\n\n### Usage\n- **Greeting**: It is used as a friendly
        and informal way to greet someone, often more casual than \"hello\".\n- **Attention**:
        It can also be used as an exclamation to call attention, similar to \"hey\"
        or \"hello\".\n\n### Variations\n- **Cultural Context**: In some cultures,
        like Hong Kong Cantonese, \"hi\" can have additional meanings or be used in
        different contexts, such as being an alternative form of \"\u5c4c\" (diu 2)
        in euphemistic or internet slang.\n- **Formal vs. Informal**: While \"hi\"
        is generally informal, it is suitable for most social interactions except
        the most formal ones, such as meeting the Queen.\n\n### Examples\n- **Casual
        Greeting**: \"Hi, how are you?\" or \"Just called to say hi\".\n- **Contextual
        Use**: \"Hi, Dior, Nars\u2014the retailer reliably satisfies our cravings
        for all things beauty\".\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used
        greeting that is appropriate in most social interactions."}, "delta": {"role":
