        term \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s
        presence. It is generally more casual than \"hello\" and is suitable for most
        social interactions, except for the most formal occasions.\n\n### Etymology\nThe
        word \"hi\" originated from Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used
        to attract attention. Over time, it evolved into a friendly and casual greeting.\n\n###
        Usage\n- **Interjection**: \"Hi\" is used as an interjection to greet someone,
        often in informal settings. It can be used in various contexts, such as when
        meeting someone, saying goodbye, or simply acknowledging their presence.\n-
        **Examples**: \"Just called to say hi,\" or \"Don''t go up and say hi\u2014your
        friend would be mortified\".\n\n### Cultural Variations\n- **Hong Kong Cantonese**:
        In Hong Kong, \"hi\" (interjection) is used similarly to its English counterpart,
        but it also has additional meanings and uses, such as being a euphemistic
        term for \"\u5c4c\" (diu 2), which is an internet slang term.\n- **Yoruba**:
        In Yoruba, \"h\u00ed\" refers to the Latin-script letter H/h and is used in
        various contexts related to the letter.\n\n### Recent References\n- **Music**:
        The term \"hi\" is also used in song titles and lyrics. For example, Hannah
        Diamond''s song \"Hi\" features sparkly sounds and lovelorn lyrics, capturing
        the essence of modern pop music.\n\n### Practical Information\n- **Cryptocurrency**:
        The term \"hi\" is also associated with a cryptocurrency platform called Hi.com,
        which is ceasing all UK operations. Users must transfer their crypto assets
        out of the platform by June 21, 2024, to avoid access removal and additional
        fees."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
