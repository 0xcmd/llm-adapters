        word \"hi\" is an informal greeting used to acknowledge or greet someone,
        typically in a casual or friendly manner. It is often used in place of \"hello\"
        and is suitable for most social interactions except in very formal settings.\n\n###
        Definition and Usage\n\n- **Interjection**: \"Hi\" is used as an informal
        greeting, especially to people you know.\n- **Examples**: \"Just called to
        say hi,\" or \"Hi, there!\".\n- **Etymology**: The word \"hi\" originated
        from a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" and was likely used to
        attract attention.\n\n### Variations and Context\n\n- **Formal vs. Informal**:
        While \"hello\" is more formal, \"hi\" is generally more casual and suitable
        for everyday use.\n- **Cultural Context**: In some cultures, \"hi\" might
        be used more frequently in small towns or among friends, but it is widely
        recognized and used globally.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n- **Other Meanings**:
        \"Hi\" can also refer to the state of Hawaii or high intensity, among other
        uses.\n- **Pronunciation**: The pronunciation of \"hi\" is typically /ha\u026a/
        in American English and /ha\u026a/ in British English.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\"
        is a versatile and commonly used greeting that is appropriate in most social
        situations."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
