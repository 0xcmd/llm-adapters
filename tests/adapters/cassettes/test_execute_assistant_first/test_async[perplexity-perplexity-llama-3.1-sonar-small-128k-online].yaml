        or \"Heat Index\" in meteorology.\n\n3. **Adjective**: In informal contexts,
        \"hi\" can be used as an adjective, such as \"hi fidelity\" for high fidelity.\n\n4.
        **Music**: The term \"Hi\" is also used in music, such as in the song \"Hi\"
        by Hannah Diamond, which features a glossy and ultra-perfectionist style.\n\n5.
