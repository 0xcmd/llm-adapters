        word \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting used to attract attention or to
        greet someone in a casual manner. Here are the key points about \"hi\" based
        on the provided sources:\n\n1. **Origin**:\n   - The word \"hi\" originated
        from Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention
        around the 15th century.\n\n2. **Usage**:\n   - \"Hi\" is used as an interjection
        to greet someone, often in informal settings. It is more casual than \"hello\"
        and is commonly used in everyday conversations.\n   - It can also be used
        to call attention or express wonder or derision, depending on the context.\n\n3.
        **Variations and Synonyms**:\n   - In different regions and cultures, similar
        greetings are used. For example, in Cantonese, it is pronounced \"haai\" (Standard
        Cantonese, Guangzhou\u2013Hong Kong), and in Norwegian Nynorsk, it is \"hee\"
        or an expression of snickering.\n   - Other greetings similar to \"hi\" include
        \"hey,\" \"hello,\" \"hiya,\" and \"howdy\".\n\n4. **Contextual Usage**:\n   -
        \"Hi\" is appropriate in most social settings but might be too informal for
        very formal occasions, such as meeting the Queen.\n   - It is widely used
        in various contexts, including in everyday conversations, social media, and
        even in some formal situations where a more casual greeting is preferred.\n\nIn
        summary, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used term for greeting someone in
        an informal manner, with its origins tracing back to Middle English."}, "delta":
