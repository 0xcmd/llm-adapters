        is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence, usually
        with people you know. Here are some key points about its usage and meaning:\n\n1.
        **Informal Greeting**:\n   - **Hi** is used as a casual way to greet someone,
        more informal than \"hello\".\n   - It''s appropriate in most social situations
        except for very formal ones, such as meeting a dignitary like the Queen.\n\n2.
        **Examples**:\n   - Common usage includes phrases like \"Hi, there!\", \"Hi,
        how are you doing?\", and \"Just called to say hi\".\n\n3. **Etymology**:\n   -
        **Hi** originally comes from a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\"
        used to attract attention around 1475.\n\n4. **Other Meanings**:\n   - **Hi**
        can also be used as an abbreviation for \"Hawaii,\" \"high intensity,\" and
        \"humidity index,\" but these are distinct from its use as a greeting.\n\n5.
        **Cultural Usage**:\n   - **Hi** is widely used in various contexts, including
        in casual conversations, emails, and even in media and advertising to convey
        a friendly tone.\n\nOverall, **hi** is a versatile and widely accepted greeting
        that is appropriate in most informal and semi-formal contexts."}, "delta":
