        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting, especially among friends
        or in casual settings. Here are some key points about its usage:\n\n- **Greeting**:
        \"Hi\" is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence
        or to initiate conversation. It is often used in place of \"hello\" in less
        formal situations.\n- **Casual Usage**: It is more casual than \"hello\" and
        is appropriate in most everyday interactions, except in very formal contexts.\n-
        **Examples**: It can be used in various ways, such as \"Hi, there!\", \"Hi,
        how are you doing?\", or simply \"Hi\" to greet someone.\n- **Etymology**:
        The first recorded use of \"hi\" as a greeting dates back to the 1800s, attributed
        to a Kansas Native American.\n- **Variations**: Other greetings similar to
        \"hi\" include \"hey\", \"hello\", \"hiya\", and \"howdy\", but \"hi\" is
        one of the most commonly used.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely
        used greeting that is suitable for most casual interactions."}, "delta": {"role":
