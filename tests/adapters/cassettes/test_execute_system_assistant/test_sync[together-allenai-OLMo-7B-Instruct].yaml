        How can I assist you today? If you''re looking to say \"Hi\" or \"Hello,\"
        both of those phrases are great ways to start a conversation or greet someone.
        Is there a specific reason you included the word \"Hi\" in your question,
        or are you just looking for a general answer? Let me know if you need help
        with anything else."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":35,"completion_tokens":75,"total_tokens":110}}'
