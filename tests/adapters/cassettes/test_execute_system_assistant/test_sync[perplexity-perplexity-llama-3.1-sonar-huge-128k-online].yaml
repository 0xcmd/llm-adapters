        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual and informal greeting, similar to
        \"hello\" but more relaxed. Here are some key points about \"hi\":\n\n1. **Usage**:
        \"Hi\" is used to greet someone, especially in informal settings. It is appropriate
        in most situations except for very formal ones.\n\n2. **Etymology**: The word
        \"hi\" is believed to have originated from Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\"
        which was used to attract attention.\n\n3. **Variations**: There are other
        forms of greetings similar to \"hi,\" such as \"hey,\" \"hello,\" \"hiya,\"
        and \"howdy,\" but \"hi\" is one of the most common.\n\n4. **Examples**: \"Hi\"
        can be used in various contexts, such as saying \"Hi, there!\" or \"Hi, how
        are you doing?\".\n\n5. **Other Meanings**: \"Hi\" can also be used as an
        exclamation to call attention or express wonder or derision, though these
        uses are less common and somewhat dated.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used greeting that is suitable for most informal interactions."},
