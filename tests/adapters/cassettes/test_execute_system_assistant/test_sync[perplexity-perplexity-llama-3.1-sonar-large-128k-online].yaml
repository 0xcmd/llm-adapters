        although this usage is less common and somewhat dated.\n\n## Additional Meanings\n-
        \"Hi\" can also be an abbreviation for various terms, such as \"Hawaii,\"
        \"high intensity,\" or \"humidity index\".\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and commonly used term for casual greetings in English."}, "delta": {"role":
