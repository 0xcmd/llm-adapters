        abbreviation for several terms, such as:\n- Hawaii (the U.S. state).\n- High
        intensity, as in high-intensity exercise or other contexts.\n- Humidity index,
        a measure of the heat stress caused by temperature and humidity.\n\n## Other

        such as Hostelling International (HI USA), a nonprofit organization that operates
        hostels and promotes cross-cultural experiences.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is
