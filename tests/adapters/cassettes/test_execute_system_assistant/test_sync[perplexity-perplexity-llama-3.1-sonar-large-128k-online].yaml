        term \"hi\" can have several meanings and contexts:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\"
        is a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence. It
        is more casual than \"hello\" and is appropriate in most social situations,
        except for very formal ones.\n\n## Interjection\nAside from being a greeting,
        \"hi\" can also be used as an interjection to attract attention or express
        a range of emotions such as wonder or surprise.\n\n## Other Uses\n- In some
        contexts, \"hi\" can be an abbreviation for other terms, such as \"high intensity\"
        or \"humidity index\".\n- It is also the name of the U.S. state Hawaii when
        abbreviated.\n\n## Specific Entities\nThere is also a Web3 neobank called
        \"hi\" which was operational but has announced the cessation of its UK operations,
        requiring users to transfer their assets by specific dates.\n\nIn summary,
        \"hi\" is predominantly used as a friendly and casual greeting, but it can
        have other meanings depending on the context."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
