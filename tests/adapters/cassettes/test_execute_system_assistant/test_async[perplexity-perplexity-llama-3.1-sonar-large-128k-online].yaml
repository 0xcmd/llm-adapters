        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual and friendly greeting. Here are
        some key points about its usage and meaning:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\" is an
        interjection used especially as a greeting, which is more casual than \"hello.\"
        It is appropriate in most informal settings but should be avoided in very
        formal circumstances.\n\n## Origin\nThe word \"hi\" has its roots in the 19th
        century, possibly as a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" and was
        first mentioned as being used by a Kansas Native American.\n\n## Usage\nIt
        is a versatile greeting that can be used in various contexts, such as when
        meeting someone, starting a conversation, or acknowledging someone''s presence.\n\n##
        Examples\n- \"Just called to say hi.\"\n- \"Don''t go up and say hi\u2014your
        friend would be mortified.\"\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting
        used to acknowledge or greet someone in a friendly manner."}, "delta": {"role":
