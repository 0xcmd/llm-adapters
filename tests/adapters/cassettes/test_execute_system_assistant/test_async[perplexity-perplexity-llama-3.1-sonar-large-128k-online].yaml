        a common, casual greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence. It is less
        formal than \"hello\" and is appropriate in most informal settings.\n\n##
        Interjection\nAs an interjection, \"hi\" can be used to attract attention
        or express a friendly acknowledgment.\n\n## Other Contexts\n- In some contexts,
        \"hi\" can be an abbreviation for other terms, such as \"high intensity\"
        or \"humidity index\".\n- It is also the name of a Web3 neobank, \"Hi,\" which
        allows users to trade, save, and spend both crypto and fiat currencies. However,
        it is noted that Hi.com is ceasing its UK operations.\n\n## Etymology\nThe
        word \"hi\" is believed to have originated from Middle English terms like
        \"hey\" or \"hy,\" used to attract attention."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
