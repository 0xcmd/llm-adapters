        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting. Here are some key points
        about its usage:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\" is a common, casual greeting used
        to acknowledge someone''s presence, especially among people you know. It is
        less formal than \"hello\".\n\n## Usage\nIt is appropriate in most everyday
        situations but is generally avoided in very formal contexts, such as when
        addressing someone of high authority or in formal events.\n\n## Examples\n-
        \"Hi, how are you?\"\n- \"Hi, there!\"\n- \"Just called to say hi\".\n\n##
        Etymology\nThe word \"hi\" may have originated from a variant of Middle English
        \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which were used to attract attention.\n\nOverall, \"hi\"
        is a versatile and widely used informal greeting in English."}, "delta": {"role":
