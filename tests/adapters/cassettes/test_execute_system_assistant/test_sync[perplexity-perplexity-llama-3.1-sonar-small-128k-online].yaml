        word \"hi\" is a common greeting, more casual than \"hello.\" It is used especially
        as a greeting and is appropriate in most informal circumstances, such as when
        meeting someone on the street or in casual social settings.\n\n### Usage Examples\n-
        **Casual Greeting**: \"Just called to say hi.\"\n- **Informal Setting**: \"When
        you walk down the street in a small town, it might seem like everyone you
        pass says ''hi.''\"\n\n### Formality\n- **Formal Circumstances**: It is generally
        not suitable to use \"hi\" in very formal situations, such as when meeting
        the Queen.\n\n### Etymology\n- The word \"hi\" has its origins attributed
        to a Kansas Native American in the 1800s."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
