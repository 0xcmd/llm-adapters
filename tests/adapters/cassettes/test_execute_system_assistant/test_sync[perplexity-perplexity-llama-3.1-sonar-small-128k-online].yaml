        word \"hi\" is an informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence
        or to express a friendly hello. It is commonly used in casual settings and
        is more relaxed than the formal greeting \"hello.\" Here are some key points
        about the word \"hi\" from various sources:\n\n- **Definition**: \"Hi\" is
        an interjection used especially as a greeting, making it a casual and friendly
        way to say hello.\n- **Etymology**: The word \"hi\" originated from English
        and has been used since the 1800s. It is a variant of Middle English \"hey\"
        or \"hy,\" which was used to attract attention.\n- **Usage**: \"Hi\" is appropriate
        in most social situations except for the most formal ones. It is widely used
        in everyday conversations, both in person and online.\n- **Examples**: The
        word \"hi\" can be used in various contexts, such as greeting someone on the
        street, in a message, or even in a formal setting like a business meeting
        (though it might be less common there).\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used greeting that is perfect for casual interactions."}, "delta":
