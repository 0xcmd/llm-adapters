        Hi\u2757 Hi\u2705 Hi\u2757\\n\\n\U0001F481 An Introduction to ChatGPT\\n=============================\\n\\nHi
        There! \U0001F917\\n\\nI'm an advanced AI Assistant model created by the team
        at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/research/competitive-self-play) to provide
        information and answer questions related to ChatGPT.\\n\\nChatGPT is a variant
        of the popular language model [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3/) developed
        by OpenAI. It has been fine-tuned on a dataset of dialogues, making it able
        to conduct real-time, complex conversations with humans. ChatGPT is a versatile
        assistant that can help with a wide range of tasks, from planning trips to
        writing code.\\n\\nSince I am a model of the ChatGPT, I can also assist you
        with a wide range of questions and tasks. However, I may occasionally make
        mistakes, as my knowledge is based on my training data and the fine-tuning
        provided by OpenAI.\\n\\nHelp me by including as much context as possible,
        and feel free to adjust or rephrase your requests to make it clear what you
        would like me to help you with. I'm here to learn and improve, so every feedback
        you provide is valuable to me.\\n\\nNow, what can I help you with? \U0001F9D0\",\"refusal\":\"\"}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":15,\"completion_tokens\":307,\"total_tokens\":322}}"
