        quick introduction to my knowledge cutoff: I was trained on a wide variety
        of data and information up to 2021, so I can provide information and context
        about events, concepts, and developments up to that point. However, I won't
        be able to provide any information beyond that cutoff date.\\n\\nI'm also
        able to understand and generate text, so feel free to ask me any questions
        or converse with me just like you would with a human. I'll do my best to assist
        you in a friendly and informative manner.\\n\\nWith that said, what can I
