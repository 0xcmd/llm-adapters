        generate tool is relevant for this request, as it can generate a random number
        based on a prompt. Looking at the parameters, it requires a \"prompt\" string
        that specifies what kind of random number to generate. \n\nThe user''s request
        of \"Generate random number\" does not directly specify the kind of random
        number they want. We would need more details on the range or type of random
        number desired to properly call the generate tool.\n\nSince no other tools
        are available that could fill in this missing information, we will need to
        ask the user to clarify their request and provide a more specific prompt for
        the kind of random number they want.\n</thinking>\n\nTo generate a random
        number, I''ll need a bit more information on what kind of random number you
        are looking for. Could you please provide a more specific prompt that indicates
        the range or type of number you want? For example, you could say something
        like \"a random number between 1 and 10\" or \"a random 3-digit number\"."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":608,"output_tokens":214}}'
