        provided tools are:\n1. generate - Generate random number\n\nTo generate a
        random number, the generate tool requires a \"prompt\" parameter specifying
        a random number as a string like \"5, 4, 3, 10, 11\".\n\nThe user''s request
        of \"Generate random number\" does not provide a specific number range. To
        properly call the generate tool, we need the user to provide more details
        on what kind of random number they want, such as the range or some example
        numbers.\n\nSince no other tools are available that could help determine the
        desired number range, we will need to ask the user for clarification before
        proceeding with the generate tool.\n</thinking>\n\nTo generate a random number,
        could you please provide some more details on what kind of number you are
        looking for? For example, specifying a range like \"between 1 and 10\" or
        giving a few example numbers like \"5, 4, 3, 10, 11\" would help me understand
        what type of random number to generate for you. Let me know and I''ll be happy
        to generate a random number based on your prompt!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":608,"output_tokens":242}}'
