        generate a random number, the \"generate\" tool needs to be called with the
        \"prompt\" parameter specified. The user gave the request \"Generate random
        number\" but did not provide any examples of the type of random number they
        want.\n\nSince no specific prompt was given, I don''t have enough information
        to infer an appropriate value for the \"prompt\" parameter. I will ask the
        user to provide an example of the type of random number they want generated.\n</thinking>\n\nTo
        generate a random number, I need a bit more information. Could you please
        provide an example of the type of random number you want, such as \"a number
        between 1 and 10\" or \"a 3 digit number\"? Once I have an example prompt,
        I''ll be able to generate the kind of random number you''re looking for."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":608,"output_tokens":177}}'
