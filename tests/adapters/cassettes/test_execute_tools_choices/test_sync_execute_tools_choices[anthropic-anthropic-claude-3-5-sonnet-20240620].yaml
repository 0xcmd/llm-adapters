        I''d be happy to generate a random number for you. However, to use the random
        number generation tool, we need to provide a prompt that specifies the type
        of random number you''re looking for. The tool description mentions that the
        prompt should be in the format of \"Random number like 5, 4, 3, 10, 11\" where
        these numbers represent examples of the range or type of numbers you want.\n\nCould
        you please provide more information about what kind of random number you''d
        like? For example:\n1. Do you want a single-digit number (like 0-9)?\n2. Do
        you want a number within a specific range (like 1-100)?\n3. Do you have any
        preferences for the size of the number (small, large, etc.)?\n\nOnce you give
        me this information, I''ll be able to use the tool to generate a random number
        that meets your requirements."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":369,"output_tokens":199}}'
