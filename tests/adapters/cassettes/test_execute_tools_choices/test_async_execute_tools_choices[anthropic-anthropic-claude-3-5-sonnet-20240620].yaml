        I''d be happy to generate a random number for you. However, I need a bit more
        information to use the random number generation tool effectively. The tool
        requires a prompt that specifies the type of random number you''d like, such
        as \"5\" for a random number between 0 and 5, or \"4, 3\" for a random number
        between 4 and 3.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the random
        number you''d like? For example:\n1. A single number like \"10\" to generate
        a random number between 0 and 10.\n2. Two numbers like \"5, 15\" to generate
        a random number between 5 and 15.\n3. Or any other specific range or type
        of random number you''re looking for.\n\nOnce you provide this information,
        I''ll be able to use the tool to generate the random number for you."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":369,"output_tokens":196}}'
