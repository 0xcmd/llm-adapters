        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting. Here are some key points
        about its usage and origins:\n\n## Usage\n- \"Hi\" is a casual and friendly
        greeting, often used when meeting someone, especially in informal settings.
        It is less formal than \"hello\" but suitable for most everyday interactions.\n\n##
        Origins\n- The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated from Middle English,
        possibly as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which dates back to around 1475.\n\n##
        Other Uses\n- Besides being a greeting, \"hi\" can also be used as an exclamation
        to call attention or express surprise.\n\n## Formality\n- While \"hi\" is
        appropriate for most social interactions, it is generally not used in very
        formal circumstances, such as when addressing someone of high authority or
        in formal events.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and commonly used greeting
        in English, suitable for a wide range of informal social interactions."},
