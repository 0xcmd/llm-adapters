        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual and informal greeting. Here are
        some key points about its usage and meaning:\n\n## Greeting\n- \"Hi\" is a
        common, friendly, and informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence
        or arrival. It is more casual than \"hello\" and suitable for most everyday
        interactions.\n\n## Usage\n- It can be used in various contexts, such as when
        meeting someone on the street, in a social setting, or even in written communication
        like emails or text messages.\n\n## Etymology\n- The origin of \"hi\" is attributed
        to a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" and it has been in use since
        at least the 1800s, with one of the earliest mentions linked to a Kansas Native
        American.\n\n## Formality\n- While \"hi\" is appropriate for most casual interactions,
        it is generally not suitable for very formal circumstances, such as greeting
        royalty or in highly formal business settings.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile
        and widely used greeting that conveys a friendly and approachable tone."},
