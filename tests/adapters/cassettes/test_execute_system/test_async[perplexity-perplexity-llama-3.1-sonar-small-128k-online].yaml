        word \"hi\" is an informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence
        or to initiate a conversation. It is commonly used in casual settings and
        is generally more informal than \"hello.\" Here are some key points about
        the word \"hi\":\n\n- **Definition**: An interjection used as a friendly,
        casual greeting, especially between people who know each other.\n- **Usage**:
        Often used in everyday conversations, both in person and online. For example,
        \"Hi, how are you?\" or \"Just called to say hi\".\n- **Etymology**: The word
        \"hi\" has its roots in English and has been used since the 19th century,
        particularly in American English.\n- **Variations**: While \"hi\" is widely
        used, other greetings like \"hey,\" \"hello,\" and \"howdy\" are also common,
        but \"hi\" is generally the most casual and widely accepted.\n\nIn summary,
        \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used greeting that is appropriate in most
        social interactions except for the most formal occasions."}, "delta": {"role":
