        term \"hi\" is primarily used as a casual and friendly greeting. Here are
        some key points about its usage:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\" is an informal, casual
        greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence or arrival. It is more casual
        than \"hello\" and is appropriate in most social situations, except for very
        formal ones.\n\n## Usage\nIt can be used in various contexts, such as when
        meeting someone on the street, starting a conversation, or as a way to get
        someone''s attention.\n\n## Examples\n- \"Just called to say hi.\"\n- \"Don''t
        go up and say hi\u2014your friend would be mortified.\".\n\n## Etymology\nThe
        first recorded use of \"hi\" as a greeting is attributed to a Kansas Native
        American in the 1800s.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and common greeting
        that is widely used in everyday interactions."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
