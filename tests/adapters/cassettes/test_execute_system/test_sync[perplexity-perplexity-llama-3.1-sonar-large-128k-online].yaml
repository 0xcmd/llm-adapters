        term \"hi\" can have several meanings and uses:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\" is
        a common, informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence. It is
        more casual than \"hello\" and is appropriate in most social interactions,
        except for very formal situations.\n\n## Interjection\nIt can also be used
        as an interjection to call attention or express a friendly acknowledgment.
        For example, \"Hi, how are you?\" or \"Hi, there!\".\n\n## Other Uses\n- In
        some contexts, \"hi\" can be an abbreviation, such as for Hawaii, high intensity,
        or humidity index.\n\n## Etymology\nThe word \"hi\" has its roots in Middle
        English, possibly as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy,\" and has been used as
        a greeting since at least the 1800s, with one of the earliest recorded uses
        attributed to a Kansas Native American.\n\nIn summary, \"hi\" is primarily
        used as a friendly and casual greeting in everyday communication."}, "delta":
