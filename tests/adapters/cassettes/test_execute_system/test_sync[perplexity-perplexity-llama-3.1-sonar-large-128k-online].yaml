        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting. Here are some key points
        about its usage and meaning:\n\n## Greeting\n- \"Hi\" is used especially as
        a greeting, often in informal settings. It is a casual alternative to \"hello\".\n\n##
        Pronunciation and Usage\n- It is pronounced as /ha\u026a/ in both US and UK
        English.\n\n## Examples\n- Common ways to use \"hi\" include: \"Hi, there!\",
        \"Hi, how are you?\", or simply \"Hi!\" when greeting someone.\n\n## Etymology\n-
        The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated from Middle English words like
        \"hey\" or \"hy\", used to attract attention or as an exclamation.\n\n## Other
        Uses\n- While \"hi\" is mainly a greeting, it can also be used in other contexts,
        such as an expression to call attention or, in some cases, to express wonder
        or derision, though these uses are less common.\n\n## Formality\n- \"Hi\"
        is generally not used in very formal situations, such as greeting royalty
        or in highly formal events.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely used
        informal greeting in English."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":
