        term \"hi\" is a common and informal greeting used in many English-speaking
        contexts. Here are some key points about its usage and meaning:\n\n## Usage\n-
        \"Hi\" is an informal greeting, often used to acknowledge someone''s presence
        or to initiate a conversation. It is more casual than \"hello\" and suitable
        for most everyday interactions.\n\n## Examples\n- It can be used in various
        ways, such as \"Hi, there!\", \"Hi, how are you?\", or simply \"Hi\".\n\n##
        Etymology\n- The origin of \"hi\" is believed to be related to the Middle
        English words \"hey\" and \"hy,\" which were used to attract attention. It
        has been in use since at least the 1800s, with one of the earliest mentions
        attributed to a Kansas Native American.\n\n## Formality\n- While \"hi\" is
        appropriate for most casual and semi-formal interactions, it is generally
        not suitable for very formal situations, such as greeting royalty or in highly
        formal professional settings.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and widely
        used greeting that is integral to everyday communication."}, "delta": {"role":
