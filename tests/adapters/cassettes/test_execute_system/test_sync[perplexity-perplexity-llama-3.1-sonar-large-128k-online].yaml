        term \"hi\" is primarily used as an informal greeting in English. Here are
        some key points about its usage and origins:\n\n## Usage\n- \"Hi\" is a casual
        and friendly greeting, often used in informal settings to acknowledge someone''s
        presence or arrival.\n- It is less formal than \"hello\" and suitable for
        most everyday interactions, except in very formal circumstances.\n\n## Origins\n-
        The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated from Middle English, possibly
        as a variant of \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which dates back to around 1475.\n\n##
        Other Uses\n- Besides being a greeting, \"hi\" can also be used as an exclamation
        to attract attention.\n\nOverall, \"hi\" is a versatile and commonly used
        term in English for greeting others in an informal manner."}, "delta": {"role":
