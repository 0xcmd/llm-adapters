        term \"hi\" is a common, informal greeting used in many English-speaking countries.
        It is often used as a casual way to acknowledge someone''s presence, similar

        casual than \"hello\" and appropriate in most social situations except the
        most formal ones.\n- **Etymology**: The word \"hi\" is believed to have originated
        from a variant of Middle English \"hey\" or \"hy,\" which was used to attract
        attention.\n- **Usage**: It is commonly used in everyday conversations, both
        in person and in writing, to greet someone or acknowledge their presence.\n-
        **Variations**: There are various forms and uses of \"hi\" across different
        cultures and languages, such as in Hong Kong Cantonese where it is used as
        an interjection similar to English.\n\nFor more specific information, you
        can refer to the definitions and examples provided by Vocabulary.com, Merriam-Webster,
        and Wiktionary."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
