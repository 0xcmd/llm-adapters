        seems like you''re looking for information on how to keep quotes around empty
        cells when saving a CSV file, particularly in LibreOffice. Here''s a summary
        based on the provided search results:\n\n1. **LibreOffice CSV Export Issue**:\n   -
        **Problem**: When saving a CSV file in LibreOffice, empty cells that were
        originally represented by quotes (\u201c\u201d) lose these quotes upon saving.\n   -
        **Solution**: There is no standard option in LibreOffice to quote empty cells
        when exporting to CSV. The only workaround is to restrict the export to a
        specific range of cells that need to be quoted. This is because quoting all
        empty cells in a large spreadsheet is impractical due to the vast number of
        empty cells (potentially up to 2^30 or more).\n\nThe other search results
        (,,) are unrelated to the CSV export issue and instead provide quotes about
        the concept of \"emptiness\" from various literary sources.\n\nIf you need
        to maintain quotes around empty cells in a CSV file, consider the following
        steps:\n- **Manual Editing**: Manually add quotes around empty cells before
        saving the file, but this is only feasible for small datasets.\n- **Scripting**:
        Use scripting languages like Python or VBA (for Excel) to automate the process
        of adding quotes around empty cells before exporting to CSV.\n- **Alternative
        Software**: Explore other spreadsheet software that might offer more flexible
        CSV export options.\n\nHowever, for large datasets, the practicality of quoting
        all empty cells is limited due to the sheer volume of data."}, "delta": {"role":
