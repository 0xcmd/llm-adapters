        query seems to be about quotes related to the concept of \"empty.\" Here are
        some key points and quotes from the provided sources:\n\n1. **Philosophical
        and Inspirational Quotes**:\n   - **Emptiness as a State of Mind**: \"The
        empty mind - the pure mind - is not a blank, zero-land, where you''re not
        feeling or caring about anything. It''s an effulgence of the mind. It''s a
        brightness that is truly sensitive and accepting. It''s an ability to accept
        life as it is.\"\n   - **Acceptance and Serenity**: \"Empty your mind of all
        thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate
        their return. Each separate being in the universe returns to the common source.
        Returning to the source is serenity.\"\n   - **Joy in Emptiness**: \"Into
        the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\"
        - C. S. Lewis\n\n2. **Empty Nest Syndrome**:\n   - **Humor**: \"Hey empty
        nest parents, if you want your kid to call you, just change your Netflix password.\"
        - Unknown\n   - **Inspiration**: \"The greatest burden a child must bear is
        the unlived life of the parents.\" - Carl Jung\n   - **Comfort**: \"Our children\u2019s
        independence is a reminder of how much we had to give and all that we have
        accomplished. It is a pleasure to remember that it is not a form of abandonment
        but an expression of a job well done.\" - Unknown\n\n3. **Literary Quotes**:\n   -
        **Loneliness**: \"All alone, in the middle of the night, Coraline began to
        cry. There was no other sound in the empty flat.\" - Neil Gaiman\n   - **Abandonment**:
        \"This closet is abandoned - it has no purpose, no name. It is the perfect
        place for me.\" - Laurie Halse Anderson\n   - **Disappointment**: \"Every
        little girl knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she thought
        somebody was.\" - George Macdonald\n\nThese quotes cover various aspects of
        emptiness, from philosophical and inspirational perspectives to the emotional
        challenges of empty nest syndrome and literary explorations of loneliness
        and abandonment."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
