        seems like you''re looking for quotes about feeling empty or empty nest syndrome.
        Here are some key points and quotes from the provided sources:\n\n### Empty
        Nest Syndrome Quotes\n1. **Humorous Perspective**:\n   - **Changing Roles**:
        \"When mothers talk about the depression of the empty nest, they\u2019re not
        mourning the passing of all those wet towels on the floor, or the music that
        numbs your teeth, or even the bottle of capless shampoo dribbling down the
        shower drain. They\u2019re upset because they\u2019ve gone from supervisor
        of a child\u2019s life to a spectator. It\u2019s like being the vice president
        of the United States.\" ~Erma Bombeck\n   - **New Labels**: \"I don\u2019t
        like the term empty nesters. I prefer \u2018parents of free range adults\u2019.\"
        ~Robin Fox\n   - **Encouraging Independence**: \"A wise parent humors the
        desire for independent action, so as to become the friend and advisor when
        his absolute rule shall cease.\" ~Elizabeth Gaskell\n\n2. **Comforting and
        Inspiring**:\n   - **Allowing Growth**: \"I think that the best thing we can
        do for our children is to allow them to do things for themselves, allow them
        to be strong, allow them to experience life on their own terms, allow them
        to take the subway...let them be better people, let them believe more in themselves.\"
        ~C. JoyBell C.\n   - **Roots and Wings**: \"Give the ones you love wings to
        fly, roots to come back, reasons to stay.\" ~Dalai Lama\n   - **Parental Growth**:
        \"It''s not only children who grow. Parents do too. As much as we watch to
        see what our children do with their lives, they are watching us to see what
        we do with ours. I can\u2019t tell my children to reach for the sun. All I
        can do is reach for it myself.\" ~Joyce Maynard\n\n### General Quotes on Emptiness\n1.
        **Emptiness as Opportunity**:\n   - **Refilling the Soul**: \"Feeling empty
        is the invitation to refill your soul with whatever brings you joy and a sense
        of purpose.\" ~Descriptionari\n   - **Freedom in Emptiness**: \"Empty is the
        perfect state of being. Nothing inside to anchor you. Nothing inside to chain
        you down, keep you from living your dreams.\" ~Ellen Hopkins\n\n2. **Philosophical
        Perspectives**:\n   - **True Emptiness**: \"True emptiness is like the inner
        openness of a bell or a drum; ineffable existence is like the sounding of
        a bell or a drum when struck.\" ~Liu Yiming\n   - **Emptiness and Fulfillment**:
        \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life
        is unfurled.\" ~C. S. Lewis\n\nThese quotes offer a range of perspectives
        on feeling empty, whether it''s related to empty nest syndrome or more general
        feelings of emptiness. They provide humor, comfort, inspiration, and philosophical
        insights to help navigate these emotions."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
