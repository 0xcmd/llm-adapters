        seems like you''re looking for quotes about the concept of \"empty\" in various
        contexts. Here are some key points and quotes from the provided sources:\n\n1.
        **Literary Quotes**:\n   - **C. S. Lewis**: \"Into the void of silence, into
        the empty space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\" This quote emphasizes
        the idea that even in emptiness, there can be joy and life.\n   - **Neil Gaiman**:
        \"All alone, in the middle of the night, Coraline began to cry. There was
        no other sound in the empty flat.\" This quote highlights the loneliness and
        fear associated with emptiness.\n   - **Lao Tzu**: \"By emptying their hearts
        And filling their bellies, Weakening their intelligence And toughening their
        sinews Ever striving to make the people knowledgeless and desireless.\" This
        quote discusses the concept of emptiness in a philosophical context, suggesting
        that it can lead to a lack of knowledge and desire.\n\n2. **Empty Nest Syndrome**:\n   -
        **Carl Jung**: \"The greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life
        of the parents.\" This quote emphasizes the importance of parents living their
        own lives and not projecting their unfulfilled dreams onto their children.\n   -
        **Erma Bombeck**: \"When mothers talk about the depression of the empty nest,
        they\u2019re not mourning the passing of all those wet towels on the floor,
        or the music that numbs your teeth, or even the bottle of capless shampoo
        dribbling down the shower drain. They\u2019re upset because they\u2019ve gone
        from supervisor of a child\u2019s life to a spectator.\" This quote humorously
        captures the emotional transition parents face when their children leave home.\n\n3.
        **Philosophical and Inspirational Quotes**:\n   - **Antonio Porchia**: \"In
        a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there is
        room for nothing.\" This quote contrasts the fullness and emptiness of the
        heart, suggesting that a full heart is more receptive and capable.\n   - **Lao
        Tzu**: \"Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch
        the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return. Each separate being in
        the universe returns to the common source. Returning to the source is serenity.\"
        This quote encourages mindfulness and acceptance, suggesting that emptiness
        can lead to peace and serenity.\n\nThese quotes provide a variety of perspectives
        on the concept of \"empty,\" ranging from literary and philosophical to humorous
        and inspirational."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
