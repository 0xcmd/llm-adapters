        you make lots of mistakes. But as you play more and more, you start to learn
        what works and what doesn't. You try different things, see what happens, and
        get better over time. Machine learning is like that but with computers. They
        learn by looking at lots of examples and figuring out patterns. Then, they
        use those patterns to make predictions or decisions, like suggesting a song
        you might like, or recognizing a cat in a picture.\",\"name\":null,\"tool_calls\":null},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":10,\"total_tokens\":147,\"completion_tokens\":137,\"estimated_cost\":9.554999999999999e-05}}"
