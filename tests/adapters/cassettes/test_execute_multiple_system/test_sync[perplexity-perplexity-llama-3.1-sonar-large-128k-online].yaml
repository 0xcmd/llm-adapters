        are some diverse and thought-provoking quotes about the concept of \"empty\"
        from various sources:\n\n## Emotional and Philosophical Perspectives\n\n-
        **C. S. Lewis**: \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing,
        the joy of life is unfurled.\"\n- **Lao Tzu**: \"Empty your mind of all thoughts.
        Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their
        return. Each separate being in the universe returns to the common source.\"\n-
        **Waylon H. Lewis**: \"Words are full of promise, yet empty of matter.\"\n\n##
        Literary and Poetic Expressions\n\n- **Neil Gaiman**: \"All alone, in the
        middle of the night, Coraline began to cry. There was no other sound in the
        empty flat.\"\n- **Laurie Halse Anderson**: \"This closet is abandoned - it
        has no purpose, no name. It is the perfect place for me.\"\n- **George Macdonald**:
        \"Every little girl knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she
        thought somebody was.\"\n\n## Empty Nest Syndrome\n\n- **Erma Bombeck**: \"When
        mothers talk about the depression of the empty nest, they\u2019re not mourning
        the passing of all those wet towels on the floor, or the music that numbs
        your teeth, or even the bottle of capless shampoo dribbling down the shower
        drain. They\u2019re upset because they\u2019ve gone from supervisor of a child\u2019s
        life to a spectator.\"\n- **C. JoyBell C.**: \"I think that the best thing
        we can do for our children is to allow them to do things for themselves, allow
        them to be strong, allow them to experience life on their own terms, allow
        them to take the subway...let them be better people, let them believe more
        in themselves.\"\n- **Dalai Lama**: \"Give the ones you love wings to fly,
        roots to come back, reasons to stay.\"\n\n## Humor and Practicality\n\n- **Unknown**:
        \"Hey empty nest parents, if you want your kid to call you, just change your
        Netflix password.\"\n- **Erma Bombeck**: \"If the nest is truly empty, who
        owns all this junk?\"\n- **Robin Fox**: \"I don\u2019t like the term empty
        nesters. I prefer \u2018parents of free range adults\u2019.\"\n\nThese quotes
        capture a range of emotions, philosophical insights, and practical humor related
        to the concept of emptiness."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":
