        you are looking for quotes related to the concept of an \"empty nest,\" which
        often refers to the period when children leave their parents'' home to start
        their independent lives, here are some notable and varied quotes:\n\n## Funny
        Quotes\n- \"Hey empty nest parents, if you want your kid to call you, just
        change your Netflix password.\" - Unknown.\n- \"When mothers talk about the
        depression of the empty nest, they\u2019re not mourning the passing of all
        those wet towels on the floor, or the music that numbs your teeth, or even
        the bottle of capless shampoo dribbling down the shower drain. They\u2019re
        upset because they\u2019ve gone from supervisor of a child\u2019s life to
        a spectator. It\u2019s like being the vice president of the United States.\u201d
        - Erma Bombeck.\n- \"I don\u2019t like the term empty nesters. I prefer \u2018parents
        of free range adults\u2019.\u201d - Robin Fox.\n\n## Comforting Quotes\n-
        \"Our children\u2019s independence is a reminder of how much we had to give
        and all that we have accomplished. It is a pleasure to remember that it is
        not a form of abandonment but an expression of a job well done.\u201d - Unknown.\n-
        \"I think that the best thing we can do for our children is to allow them
        to do things for themselves, allow them to be strong, allow them to experience
        life on their own terms, allow them to take the subway...let them be better
        people, let them believe more in themselves.\u201d - C. JoyBell C..\n\n##
        Inspiring Quotes\n- \"Give the ones you love wings to fly, roots to come back,
        reasons to stay.\u201d - Dalai Lama.\n- \"It''s not only children who grow.
        Parents do too. As much as we watch to see what our children do with their
        lives, they are watching us to see what we do with ours. I can\u2019t tell
        my children to reach for the sun. All I can do is reach for it myself.\" -
        Joyce Maynard.\n\n## Sad but Touching Quotes\n- \"As a parent, you quickly
        realize that life is one long series of letting go: watching your kid crawl,
        then walk, then run, and then drive away.\u201d - Deborah Mitchell.\n- \"Empty
        nest is not just about the loud quiet. It\u2019s about being at the center
        of your own life where your kids used to be. You\u2019ll be encouraged to
        embrace your freedom, go back to school, volunteer, but coming first again
        is not as easy as it sounds. It feels like wearing shoes on the wrong feet.\u201d
        - Susan Bonifant.\n\nThese quotes capture the various emotions and reflections
        that parents often experience during the empty nest phase."}, "delta": {"role":
