        term \"hi\" has several meanings and uses:\n\n## Greeting\n\"Hi\" is a common,
        informal greeting used to acknowledge someone''s presence or to initiate a
        conversation. It is more casual than \"hello\" and is appropriate in most
        social settings, except for very formal occasions.\n\n## Interjection\nAs
        an interjection, \"hi\" can be used to call attention or to express a friendly
        acknowledgment.\n\n## Abbreviation\n\"HI\" can also be an abbreviation for
        several terms, including:\n- Hawaii\n- High intensity\n- Humidity index.\n\n##
        Other Contexts\nIn some contexts, \"hi\" can have different meanings or uses,
        such as in specific languages or dialects. For example, in Hong Kong Cantonese,
        it can be used as an alternative form of a different word, and in Norwegian
        Nynorsk, it has various meanings including \"lair\" or an expression of snickering.\n\nOverall,
        the most common use of \"hi\" is as a friendly and informal greeting."}, "delta":
