        are some insightful and varied quotes about the concept of \"empty\" from
        different contexts:\n\n## Emotional and Philosophical Perspectives\n\n- **C.
        S. Lewis**: \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the
        joy of life is unfurled.\"\n- **Antonio Porchia**: \"In a full heart there
        is room for everything, and in an empty heart there is room for nothing.\"\n-
        **Lao Tzu**: \"Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace.
        Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return. Each separate being
        in the universe returns to the common source.\"\n\n## Literary and Narrative
        Contexts\n\n- **Neil Gaiman**: \"All alone, in the middle of the night, Coraline
        began to cry. There was no other sound in the empty flat.\" (From \"Coraline\")\n-
        **Laurie Halse Anderson**: \"This closet is abandoned - it has no purpose,
        no name. It is the perfect place for me.\" (From \"Speak\")\n- **George Macdonald**:
        \"Every little girl knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she
        thought somebody was.\" (From \"The Princess and the Goblin\")\n\n## Empty
        Nest Syndrome\n\n- **Erma Bombeck**: \"When mothers talk about the depression
        of the empty nest, they\u2019re not mourning the passing of all those wet
        towels on the floor, or the music that numbs your teeth, or even the bottle
        of capless shampoo dribbling down the shower drain. They\u2019re upset because
        they\u2019ve gone from supervisor of a child\u2019s life to a spectator.\"\n-
        **C. JoyBell C.**: \"I think that the best thing we can do for our children
        is to allow them to do things for themselves, allow them to be strong, allow
        them to experience life on their own terms, allow them to take the subway...let
        them be better people, let them believe more in themselves.\"\n- **Deborah
        Mitchell**: \"As a parent, you quickly realize that life is one long series
        of letting go: watching your kid crawl, then walk, then run, and then drive
        away.\"\n\n## Humor and Lighter Perspectives\n\n- **Unknown**: \"Hey empty
        nest parents, if you want your kid to call you, just change your Netflix password.\"\n-
        **Erma Bombeck**: \"If the nest is truly empty, who owns all this junk?\"\n-
        **Robin Fox**: \"I don\u2019t like the term empty nesters. I prefer \u2018parents
        of free range adults\u2019.\"\n\nThese quotes cover a range of themes, from
        the philosophical and emotional to the humorous and practical, highlighting
        different aspects of what it means for something or someone to be \"empty.\""},
