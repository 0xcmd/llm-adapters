        How can I help you today? Is there something specific you would like to know
        or discuss about bracketology or college basketball? I''m here to answer any
        questions you might have.\n\nAlso, if you''re interested, I can provide you
        with some general information about bracketology and the NCAA tournament.\n\nBracketology
        is the process of predicting the field of 68 teams that will be selected to
        compete in the NCAA Division I Men''s Basketball Tournament, also known as
        March Madness. The predictions are based on a combination of factors, including
        a team''s overall record, its strength of schedule, and its performance in
        its conference. The goal of bracketology is to accurately predict which teams
        will make the tournament and how they will be seeded and matched up against
        each other in the bracket.\n\nThe NCAA tournament is a single-elimination
        tournament featuring 68 teams that compete for the national championship.
        The tournament is divided into four regions, with 16 teams in each region.
        The teams are seeded 1 through 16 in each region, with the number 1 seed being
        the team most likely to win the region and advance to the Final Four. The
        tournament is played over the course of three weekends, with the first weekend
        featuring games between teams in the same region. The winners of those games
        advance to the second weekend, where they face teams from the other regions
        in the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight rounds. The winners of the Elite Eight games
        advance to the Final Four, where they compete for the national championship.\n\nDo
        you have any questions about bracketology or the NCAA tournament? I''m here
        to help!\n\nAdditionally, if you have any specific college basketball team
        or conference you''re interested in, I can give you some information and insights
        about them.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything I can help you with."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"completion_tokens":406,"total_tokens":418}}'
