        seems like you''re looking for quotes about emptiness. Here are some relevant
        quotes from various sources:\n\n1. **C. S. Lewis**: \"Into the void of silence,
        into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\" - From Bookroo''s
        collection of quotes about emptiness.\n\n2. **Debasish Mridha**: \"I am not
        me, I am not a human being. I am empty. Infinite emptiness dwells in me. I
        am the spirit. Emptiness is me.\" - From Creatosaurus''s collection of empty
        quotes.\n\n3. **Ellen Hopkins**: \"Empty is the perfect state of being. Nothing
        inside to anchor you. Nothing inside to chain you down, keep you from living
        your dreams. Empty, almost weightless, you are an eyelash afloat on a blink
        of breeze. You can rise about tension and worry, loosed from the grip of gravity.
        Adrift in thermal lift, you ride the wing of freedom and soar. Empty, you
        are Eve in Eden. Empty, you are what you were meant to be.\" - From Creatosaurus''s
        collection of empty quotes.\n\n4. **Mehmet Murat ildan**: \"Wherever you see
        an empty life, or an empty page or an empty mind, add something good to it!\"
        - From Creatosaurus''s collection of empty quotes.\n\n5. **Liu Yiming**: \"True
        emptiness is like the inner openness of a bell or a drum; ineffable existence
        is like the sounding of a bell or a drum when struck. If people can keep this
        true emptiness as their essence, and utilize this ineffable existence as their
        function, ever serene yet ever responsive, ever responsive yet ever serene,
        tranquil and unstirring yet sensitive and effective, sensitive and effective
        yet tranquil and unstirring, empty yet not empty, not empty yet empty, aware
        and efficient, lively and active, refining everything in the great furnace
        of Creation, then when the dirt is gone the mirror is clear, when the clouds
        disperse the moon appears; revealing the indestructible body of reality, they
        transcend yin and yang and Creation, and merge with the eternity of space.\"
        - From Creatosaurus''s collection of empty quotes.\n\nThese quotes highlight
        various aspects of emptiness, from its role in spiritual growth to its impact
        on personal freedom and the human experience."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
