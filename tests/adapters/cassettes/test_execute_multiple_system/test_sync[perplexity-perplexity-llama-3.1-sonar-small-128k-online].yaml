        seems like you might be looking for quotes about the concept of \"empty\"
        or related themes. Here are some relevant quotes from the sources provided:\n\n###
        Quotes about Emptiness\n\n1. **Neil Gaiman** - \"All alone, in the middle
        of the night, Coraline began to cry. There was no other sound in the empty
        flat.\" - From \"Coraline\" by Neil Gaiman\n\n2. **Laurie Halse Anderson**
        - \"This closet is abandoned - it has no purpose, no name. It is the perfect
        place for me.\" - From \"Speak\" by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\n3. **C. S. Lewis**
        - \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of
        life is unfurled.\" - From C.S. Lewis Quotes about Joy\n\n4. **Debasish Mridha**
        - \"I am not me, I am not a human being. I am empty. Infinite emptiness dwells
        in me. I am the spirit. Emptiness is me.\" - From various sources\n\n5. **Ellen
        Hopkins** - \"Empty is the perfect state of being. Nothing inside to anchor
        you. Nothing inside to chain you down, keep you from living your dreams. Empty,
        almost weightless, you are an eyelash afloat on a blink of breeze. You can
        rise about tension and worry, loosed from the grip of gravity. Adrift in thermal
        lift, you ride the wing of freedom and soar. Empty, you are Eve in Eden. Empty,
        you are what you were meant to be.\" - From various sources\n\n6. **Mehmet
        Murat ildan** - \"Wherever you see an empty life, or an empty page or an empty
        mind, add something good to it!\" - From various sources\n\n7. **Lao Tzu**
        - \"By emptying their hearts And filling their bellies, Weakening their intelligence
        And toughening their sinews Ever striving to make the people knowledgeless
        and desireless.\" - From \"Tao Te Ching\" by Lao Tzu\n\n8. **Jean Rhys** -
        \"I am empty of everything. I am empty of everything but the thin, frail ghosts
        in my room.\" - From \"Good Morning, Midnight\" by Jean Rhys\n\n9. **C. JoyBell
        C.** - \"In this world, we are surrounded by fast-paced, empty static energy.
        They''re like the empty calories of the soul. You have empty calories for
        your body, like a bag of potato chips for example, then you have empty calories
        for your soul, which are found in the static energy that doesn''t really add
        to our emotional, spiritual, mental experience of living our lives. We have
        magical moments of connection with people, with nature, with Spirit, but then
        we rush out of those moments all too fast, in order to go straight back into
        the busy lanes that are full of things not worthwhile. Empty energies So when
        we do that, we forget our magical, nourishing soul moments all too fast and
        we start caring about things that we shouldn''t care about too much, stepping
        outside of the moments of eternity that we encounter, and going back into
        the empty noise. So I think that we need to picture ourselves as rocks in
        the river; we can let all of that rush by us, while we stay fortified where
        we are, lingering in the warmness of the noontime sun, the chill of the dawn,
        the reflections of dusk\u2014 like a rock in a river\u2014 let it all just
        rush by. Be magic.\" - From various sources\n\nThese quotes capture various
        aspects of emptiness, from the emotional and psychological to the philosophical
        and spiritual. They offer insights into how emptiness can be both a state
        of being and an invitation for growth and renewal."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
