        empty nest parents, if you want your kid to call you, just change your Netflix
        password.\u201d** - Unknown\n2. **\u201cWhen mothers talk about the depression
        of the empty nest, they\u2019re not mourning the passing of all those wet
        towels on the floor, or the music that numbs your teeth, or even the bottle
        of capless shampoo dribbling down the shower drain. They\u2019re upset because
        they\u2019ve gone from supervisor of a child\u2019s life to a spectator. It\u2019s
        like being the vice president of the United States.\u201d** ~Erma Bombeck\n3.
        **\u201cI don\u2019t like the term empty nesters. I prefer \u2018parents of
        free range adults\u2019.\u201d** ~Robin Fox\n\n### Comforting Empty Nest Syndrome
        Quotes\n1. **\u201cI think that the best thing we can do for our children
        is to allow them to do things for themselves, allow them to be strong, allow
        them to experience life on their own terms, allow them to take the subway...let
        them be better people, let them believe more in themselves.\u201d** ~C. JoyBell
        C.\n2. **\u201cOur children\u2019s independence is a reminder of how much
        we had to give and all that we have accomplished. It is a pleasure to remember
        that it is not a form of abandonment but an expression of a job well done.\u201d**
        ~Unknown\n\n### Inspiring Empty Nest Syndrome Quotes\n1. **\u201cThe greatest
        burden a child must bear is the unlived life of the parents.\u201d** ~Carl
        Jung\n2. **\u201cGive the ones you love wings to fly, roots to come back,
        reasons to stay.\u201d** ~Dalai Lama\n\n### Sad (But Touching) Empty Nest
        Syndrome Quotes\n1. **\u201cAs a parent, you quickly realize that life is
        one long series of letting go: watching your kid crawl, then walk, then run,
        and then drive away.\u201d** ~Deborah Mitchell\n2. **\u201cThere are two times
        when parenting is the most difficult. When the baby first arrives at home,
        and when the adult first leaves the home.\u201d** ~Jennifer Quinn\n\nIf you
        have a specific context or theme in mind, please provide more details so I
        can give a more precise answer."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":
