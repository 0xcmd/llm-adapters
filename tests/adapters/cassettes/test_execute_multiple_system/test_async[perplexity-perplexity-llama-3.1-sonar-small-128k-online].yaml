        seems like your query is incomplete. However, if you''re asking about how
        to keep empty quotes when saving a CSV file in LibreOffice, here\u2019s the
        relevant information:\n\nTo keep empty quotes when saving a CSV file in LibreOffice,
        you need to ensure that the empty cells are properly represented in the CSV
        format. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Set the Separator and String Delimiter**:
        When saving your file as a CSV, click on \"Edit filter settings\" and set
        the separator and string delimiter (in this case, double quotes) as needed.\n\n2.
        **Check for Formulas**: If you have formulas that return two double quotes,
        ensure that you save the file as calculated values rather than formulae. This
        will prevent the empty quotes from being lost.\n\n3. **Export Empty Cells**:
        If you have headings for your columns, the empty cells will be exported but
        just defined by the separator. For example, if you have a structure like:\n\n```\n\"Current\";\"Fruit
        1\";\"Fruit 2\";\"Fruit 3\";\"Fruit 4\";\"Fruit 5\"\n\"ex\";\"apple\";\"banana\";;;\n```\n\nThe
        empty cells will be represented by the separator.\n\nBy following these steps,
        you should be able to keep the empty quotes in your CSV file. If you have
        any specific context or additional details, please provide them so I can give
        a more precise answer."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
