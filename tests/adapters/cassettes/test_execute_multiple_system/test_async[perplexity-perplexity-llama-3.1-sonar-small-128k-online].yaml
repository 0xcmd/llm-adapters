        seems like your query is incomplete. However, if you''re looking for quotes
        about emptiness or empty nest syndrome, here are some relevant insights and
        quotes from the sources provided:\n\n### Emptiness Quotes\n\n1. **\"In a full
        heart there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there is room for
        nothing.\"** - Antonio Porchia\n2. **\"Empty is the perfect state of being.
        Nothing inside to anchor you. Nothing inside to chain you down, keep you from
        living your dreams.\"** - Ellen Hopkins\n3. **\"I am not me, I am not a human
        being. I am empty. Infinite emptiness dwells in me. I am the spirit. Emptiness
        is me.\"** - Debasish Mridha\n4. **\"If emptiness is empty, how can something
        be borne or awaken from it?\"** - Dejan Stojanovic, The Sign and Its Children\n5.
        **\"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of
        life is unfurled.\"** - C. S. Lewis\n\n### Empty Nest Syndrome Quotes\n\n1.
        **\"The greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of the parents.\"**
        - Carl Jung\n2. **\"Give the ones you love wings to fly, roots to come back,
        reasons to stay.\"** - Dalai Lama\n3. **\"It''s not only children who grow.
        Parents do too. As much as we watch to see what our children do with their
        lives, they are watching us to see what we do with ours. I can\u2019t tell
        my children to reach for the sun. All I can do is reach for it myself.\"**
        - Joyce Maynard\n4. **\"As a parent, you quickly realize that life is one
        long series of letting go: watching your kid crawl, then walk, then run, and
        then drive away.\"** - Deborah Mitchell\n\nThese quotes capture various aspects
        of emptiness and the transition experienced during empty nest syndrome. If
        you have a specific context or theme in mind, please provide more details
        so I can tailor the response accordingly."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
