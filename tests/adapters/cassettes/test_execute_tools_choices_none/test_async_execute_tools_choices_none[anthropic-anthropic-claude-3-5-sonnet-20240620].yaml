        I''d be happy to generate a random number for you. However, I need a bit more
        information to use the random number generation tool effectively. The tool
        requires a prompt that specifies the type of random number you''d like, such
        as \"5\" for a random number between 0 and 5, or \"4, 3\" for a random number
        between 4 and 3.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the range
        or type of random number you''d like? For example:\n1. A single number like
        \"10\" to generate a random number between 0 and 10\n2. Two numbers like \"5,
        15\" to generate a random number between 5 and 15\n3. Multiple numbers like
        \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\" to pick a random number from this set\n\nOnce you provide
        this information, I''ll be able to generate the random number for you."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":369,"output_tokens":204}}'
