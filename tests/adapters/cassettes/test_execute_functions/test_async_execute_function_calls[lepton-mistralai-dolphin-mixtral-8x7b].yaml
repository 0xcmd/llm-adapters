        Python programming language is a high-level, interpreted language that provides
        extensive support for integration with other languages and operating systems.
        It is a preferred choice for many developers and researchers due to its high
        readability, easy learning curve, and versatility.\n\nIn Python, you can import
        built-in libraries (modules) to perform different tasks. For example, you
        can use the built-in `random` module to generate random numbers.\n\nHere is
        an example of how you can generate a random integer in Python:\n\n```python\nimport
        random\n\nrandom_number = random.randint(1, 10)\n\nprint(random_number)\n```\n\nIn
        this code:\n\n1. The `random` module is imported.\n2. The `randint(1, 10)`
        function from the `random` module generates a random integer between the values
        1 and 10 (inclusive).\n3. This random integer is assigned to the variable
        `random_number`.\n4. The `print()` function is used to output the value of
        `random_number`.\n\nWhen you run this script, it will output a random integer
        between 1 and ","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null,"asr_results":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"total_tokens":268,"completion_tokens":256}}'
