        sorry, but I am not able to generate truly random numbers. As a language model
        AI, I don''t have the capability to generate random numbers internally or
        access external sources of randomness.\n\nIf you need a random number for
        a specific purpose, I recommend using a random number generator available
        in the programming language or environment you are working with. Most programming
        languages have built-in functions or libraries that provide random number
        generation functionality.\n\nAlternatively, if you are looking for a random
        number for casual purposes, you can try using online random number generators
        or rolling dice physically.\n\nLet me know if there is anything else I can
        assist you with!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"output_tokens":137}}'
