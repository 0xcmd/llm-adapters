        I see you''d like to use JSON. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight
        data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy
        for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript
        Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.\n\nJSON
        is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions
        that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C,
        C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties
        make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.\n\nJSON is built on two structures:\n\n*
        A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as
        an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative
        array.\n* An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as
        an array, vector, list, or sequence.\n\nHere''s an example of a JSON object:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\":
        \"John\",\n  \"age\": 30,\n  \"city","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null,"asr_results":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"total_tokens":268,"completion_tokens":256}}'
