        I see you''d like to use JSON. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight
        data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy
        for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript
        Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.\n\nHere''s
        an example of a JSON object:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"age\":
        30,\n  \"isStudent\": false,\n  \"address\": {\n    \"street\": \"123 Main
        St\",\n    \"city\": \"Anytown\",\n    \"state\": \"CA\",\n    \"zip\": \"12345\"\n  },\n  \"hobbies\":
        [\"swimming\", \"reading\", \"coding\"]\n}\n```\nThis JSON object contains
        several properties, such as `name`, `age`, `isStudent`, `address`, and `hobbies`.
        The `address` property is another JSON object, and the `hobbies` property
        is an array of strings.\n\nYou","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null,"asr_results":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"total_tokens":268,"completion_tokens":256}}'
