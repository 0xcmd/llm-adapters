        (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that
        is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
        It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262
        3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language
        independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family
        of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many
        others.\n\nHere is a simple example of JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"firstName\":
        \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"isAlive\": true,\n  \"age\": 25,\n  \"address\":
        {\n    \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\n    \"city\": \"New York\",\n    \"state\":
        \"NY\",\n    \"postalCode\": \"10021-3100\"\n  },\n  \"phoneNumbers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\":
        \"home\",\n      \"number\": \"","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null,"asr_results":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":11,"total_tokens":267,"completion_tokens":256}}'
