        JSON (short for JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
        format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to
        parse and generate. It is based on a subset of JavaScript syntax and is commonly
        used to transmit data between a server and a web application or client.\n\nHere
        is an example of a simple JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"age\":
        30,\n  \"isMarried\": false,\n  \"hobbies\": [\"reading\", \"swimming\", \"gaming\"],\n  \"address\":
        {\n    \"street\": \"123 Main St\",\n    \"city\": \"Anytown\",\n    \"state\":
        \"NY\",\n    \"zip\": \"12345\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWould you like to see an example
        of how to use JSON in a specific programming language, or do you have a specific
        task or question in mind?","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop","audio":null,"asr_results":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"total_tokens":206,"completion_tokens":194}}'
