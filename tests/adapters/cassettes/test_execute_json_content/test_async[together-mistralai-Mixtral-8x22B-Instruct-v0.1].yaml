        It seems like you''re trying to display an object, but it''s showing up as
        \"[object Object]\". This is because JavaScript is trying to convert the object
        to a string, which doesn''t work as expected.\n\nTo view the contents of the
        object, you can use `console.log()` or `JSON.stringify()`. Here''s an example:\n\n```javascript\nlet
        obj1 = {name: \"John\", age: 30};\nlet obj2 = {city: \"New York\", country:
        \"USA\"};\n\nconsole.log(obj1, obj2);\n// or\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(obj1),
        JSON.stringify(obj2));\n```\n\nThis will print the objects in a readable format.
        If you''re trying to display these objects in an HTML document, you might
        want to convert them to a string first using `JSON.stringify()`, then display
        the string."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":11,"completion_tokens":205,"total_tokens":216}}'
