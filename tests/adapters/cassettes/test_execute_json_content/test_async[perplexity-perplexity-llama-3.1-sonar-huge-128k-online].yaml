        0, "finish_reason": "stop", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Hi,
        Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings.
        Here are some key points about the song:\n\n1. **Release**: It was released
        as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" on December 1, 1972, in the UK and
        December 4, 1972, in the USA.\n\n2. **Chart Performance**: The single peaked
        at number one in Spain, number five in the United Kingdom, and number 10 in
        the United States in January 1973.\n\n3. **Ban**: The song was banned by the
        BBC in the UK due to its sexually suggestive lyrical content and the assumption
        that the title phrase \"We''re gonna get hi, hi, hi\" was a drug reference.
        Paul McCartney clarified that the lyrics were misunderstood and that \"get
        you ready for my polygon\" was an abstract image, not a reference to drugs
        or explicit content.\n\n4. **Live Performances**: The song became a staple
        of Wings'' live shows in the 1970s and was featured in various live performances,
        including the 1976 \"Wings Over America\" tour.\n\n5. **Inclusion in Compilations**:
        \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" was included on several Paul McCartney compilation albums,
        such as \"Wingspan: Hits and History\" (2001), \"Pure McCartney\" (2016),
        and \"The 7\" Singles Box\" (2022).\n\n6. **Music Videos**: There are multiple
        versions of the music video, including one filmed at Southern TV studios in
        Northam, England, on November 25, 1972, and another version produced by MPL
        as part of the promotion for the TV special and album \"Wingspan\" in 2001."},
