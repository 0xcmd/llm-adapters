        Hi, Hi\" is a song by Paul McCartney and Wings, released in 1972 as a double
        A-side single with \"C Moon.\" The song was written by Paul and Linda McCartney
        and produced by Paul McCartney. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London
        and peaked at number one in Spain, number five in the UK, and number 10 in
        the US in January 1973.\n\nThe song was included on several compilation albums,
        such as \"Wingspan: Hits and History\" (2001), \"Pure McCartney\" (2016),
        and \"The 7\" Singles Box\" (2022). It was also included as a bonus track
        on the reissues of \"Red Rose Speedway\" in 1993 and 2018.\n\n\"Hi, Hi, Hi\"
        was banned by the BBC in the UK due to its sexually suggestive lyrics, which
        were misinterpreted by the BBC. The song became a staple of Wings'' live shows
        in the 1970s and continues to be celebrated for its catchy melody and energetic
        performance."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
