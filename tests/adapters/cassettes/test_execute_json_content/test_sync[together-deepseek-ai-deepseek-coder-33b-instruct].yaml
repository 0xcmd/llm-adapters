        seems like you''re trying to print out two objects. However, without more
        context, it''s hard to provide a specific solution. \n\nIf you''re using JavaScript,
        you can use the `console.log()` function to print out the contents of an object.
        Here''s an example:\n\n```javascript\nlet obj1 = {name: ''John'', age: 30};\nlet
        obj2 = {name: ''Jane'', age: 25};\n\nconsole.log(obj1);\nconsole.log(obj2);\n```\n\nIf
        you''re using another programming language, the method to print out an object
        will depend on that language.\n\nIf you''re trying to print out the string
        representation of two objects, you might want to use `toString()` method:\n\n```javascript\nlet
        obj1 = {name: ''John'', age: 30};\nlet obj2 = {name: ''Jane'', age: 25};\n\nconsole.log(obj1.toString());\nconsole.log(obj2.toString());\n```\n\nPlease
        provide more context if you''re trying to do something else.\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":256,"total_tokens":275}}'
