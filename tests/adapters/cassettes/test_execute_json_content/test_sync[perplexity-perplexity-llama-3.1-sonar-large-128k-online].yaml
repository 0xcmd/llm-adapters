        It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, with Paul McCartney as the
        producer. The song features Paul McCartney on vocals, bass, and electric guitar,
        Linda McCartney on backing vocals and organ, Denny Laine on backing vocals
        and electric guitar, Henry McCullough on electric guitar, and Denny Seiwell
