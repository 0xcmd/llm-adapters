        term \"HiHi\" can refer to several different entities and concepts, depending
        on the context:\n\n## Hihi Studios\nThis is a media company founded by Rachell
        ''Valkyrae'' Hofstetter, a well-known streamer and content creator. Hihi Studios
        focuses on developing and producing intellectual property for graphic novels,
        TV, and film projects.\n\n## HiHi Ltd\nThis is a UK-based company that specializes
        in VoIP phone systems for businesses. They offer products such as HiHi4, HiHi
        Connect, and HiHi There, which are designed to facilitate business communication
        and remote work.\n\n## Linguistic and Cultural References\n- In English, \"hihi\"
        can be an alternative form of the interjection \"hehe,\" used to express laughter
        or amusement.\n- In Hong Kong Cantonese, \"hihi\" is internet slang with various
        euphemistic meanings, often related to the phrase \"\u4ec6\u8857\" (which
        can be translated to \"to fall down\" or used in a more vulgar context).\n-
        In Tokelauan, \"hihi\" can mean \"to hoist\" or \"to hang,\" derived from
        Proto-Nuclear Polynesian and Proto-Polynesian roots.\n\n## Other Uses\n- There
        are also other minor references, such as a delivery service mentioned on a
        website, but these are less prominent and not as widely recognized as the
        above examples."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
