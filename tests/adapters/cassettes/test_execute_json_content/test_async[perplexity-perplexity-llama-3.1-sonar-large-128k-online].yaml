        Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney, and performed by the
        band Wings. Here are some key points about the song:\n\n## Release\n- The
        song was released as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" on December 1,
        1972, in the UK and December 4, 1972, in the USA.\n\n## Recording\n- It was
        recorded at EMI Studios, Abbey Road, in September 1972, and mixed in November
        1972.\n\n## Genre and Reception\n- The song is classified under the glam rock
        genre and received positive reviews for its infectious chorus and instrumental
        breaks. It was described as \"good old rock ''n roll\" by *Cash Box* and a
        \"steady rocker\" by *Record World*.\n\n## Chart Performance\n- The single
        peaked at number one in Spain, number five in the UK, number 10 in the USA,
        and number 18 in Ireland.\n\n## Ban by the BBC\n- The song was banned by the
        BBC in the UK due to its sexually suggestive lyrics and the misconception
        that the phrase \"We''re gonna get hi, hi, hi\" referred to drug use. Paul
        McCartney clarified that the lyrics were misinterpreted and that the song
        was written in a sensuous mood while in Spain.\n\n## Live Performances\n-
        \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" became a staple of Wings'' live shows in the 1970s and was
        often introduced with a mention of its ban, which would elicit a positive
        reaction from the audience.\n\n## Compilations and Reissues\n- The song has
        been included in several compilation albums, including *Wingspan: Hits and
        History*, *Pure McCartney*, and reissues of *Red Rose Speedway*. It was also
        part of *The 7\" Singles Box* released in 2022."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
