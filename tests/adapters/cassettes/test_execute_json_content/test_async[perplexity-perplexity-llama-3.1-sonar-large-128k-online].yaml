        0, "finish_reason": "stop", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Hi,
        Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by the
        band Wings. Here are some key points about the song:\n\n## Release\n- The
        song was released as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" on December 1,
        1972, in the UK and December 4, 1972, in the USA.\n\n## Recording\n- It was
        recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in 1972. The studio sessions took
        place on September 20, 1972, and the mixing was done on November 6, 1972.\n\n##
        Genre and Reception\n- The song is classified under the glam rock genre. It
        received positive reviews, with descriptions such as \"good old rock ''n roll\"
        and \"a steady rocker with an infectious chorus and terrific instrumental
        breaks\".\n\n## Chart Performance\n- The single peaked at number one in Spain,
        number five in the UK, number 10 in the USA, and number 18 in Ireland.\n\n##
        Ban by the BBC\n- The song was banned by the BBC due to its sexually suggestive
        lyrics and the assumption that the phrase \"We''re gonna get hi, hi, hi\"
        referred to drug use. Paul McCartney clarified that the lyrics were misinterpreted,
        particularly the line \"get you ready for my polygon,\" which was not a drug
        reference.\n\n## Live Performances\n- \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" became a staple of Wings''
        live shows in the 1970s and was featured in their live performances, including
        the 1976 \"Wings Over America\" tour.\n\n## Compilations and Reissues\n- The
        song has been included in several compilation albums, such as \"Wingspan:
        Hits and History\" (2001), \"Pure McCartney\" (2016 deluxe edition), and reissues
        of \"Red Rose Speedway\" (1993 and 2018).\n\n## Music Videos\n- There are
        multiple video versions of the song, including a restored version from the
        \"Red Rose Speedway Archive Collection\" and a live version produced for the
        TV special and album \"Wingspan\"."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":
