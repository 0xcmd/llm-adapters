        Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by the
        band Wings. Here are some key points about the song:\n\n## Release\n- The
        song was released as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" on December 1,
        1972, in the UK and December 4, 1972, in the USA.\n\n## Recording\n- It was
        recorded at EMI Studios, Abbey Road, in 1972. The session recording took place
        on September 20, 1972, and the mixing was done on November 6, 1972.\n\n##
        Genre and Reception\n- The song is classified under the glam rock genre. It
        received positive reviews, with descriptions such as \"good old rock ''n roll\"
        and a \"steady rocker with an infectious chorus\".\n\n## Chart Performance\n-
        The single peaked at number one in Spain, number five in the UK, number 10
        in the USA, and number 18 in Ireland.\n\n## Controversy and Ban\n- The song
        was banned by the BBC due to its sexually suggestive lyrics and the misconception
        that the phrase \"We''re gonna get hi, hi, hi\" referred to drug use. Paul
        McCartney clarified that the lyrics were misinterpreted and that the song
        was written in a sensuous mood while in Spain.\n\n## Live Performances\n-
        \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" became a staple of Wings'' live shows in the 1970s and was
        often introduced with a mention of its ban, which would elicit a positive
        reaction from the audience.\n\n## Compilations\n- The song has been included
        on several compilation albums, including *Wingspan: Hits and History*, *Pure
        McCartney*, and reissues of *Red Rose Speedway*."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
