        0, "finish_reason": "stop", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Hi,
        Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings.
        Here are some key points about the song:\n\n1. **Release**: The song was released
        as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" on December 1, 1972, in the UK and
        on December 4, 1972, in the USA.\n\n2. **Ban**: The song was banned by the
        BBC in the UK due to its sexually suggestive lyrical content and the assumption
        that the title phrase \"We''re gonna get hi, hi, hi\" was a drug reference.
        However, Paul McCartney clarified that the lyrics were misinterpreted and
        that the song was meant to be a harmless rock and roll song.\n\n3. **Chart
        Performance**: The single peaked at number one in Spain, number five in the
        United Kingdom, and at number 10 in the United States in January 1973. It
        also reached number 18 in Ireland.\n\n4. **Inclusion in Compilations**: The
        song has been included in various Paul McCartney compilation albums, such
        as \"Wingspan: Hits and History\" (2001), \"Pure McCartney\" (2016), and as
        a bonus track on the 1993 and 2018 reissues of \"Red Rose Speedway\".\n\n5.
        **Live Performances**: \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" became a staple of Wings'' live shows
        in the 1970s, often being introduced with the announcement \"This one was
        banned!\" to elicit a positive reaction from the audience.\n\n6. **Remasters
        and Re-releases**: The song has been remastered and re-released in various
        formats, including the 2018 remaster available on YouTube."}, "delta": {"role":
