        0, "finish_reason": "stop", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Hi,
        Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings.
        Here are some key points about the song:\n\n1. **Release**: The song was released
        as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" in 1972. It was issued on December
        1, 1972, in the UK and on December 4, 1972, in the USA.\n\n2. **Chart Performance**:
        The single peaked at number one in Spain, number five in the United Kingdom,
        and at number 10 in the United States in January 1973. It also reached number
        18 in Ireland.\n\n3. **Ban**: The song was banned by the BBC in the UK due
        to its sexually suggestive lyrical content and the assumption that the title
        phrase \"We''re gonna get hi, hi, hi\" was a drug reference. Paul McCartney
        clarified that the lyrics were misunderstood and that the song was intended
        to be a harmless rock and roll song.\n\n4. **Live Performances**: \"Hi, Hi,
        Hi\" became a staple of Wings'' live shows in the 1970s. A live performance
        of the song from the 1976 \"Wings Over America\" tour was used in a promotional
        video for the \"Wingspan\" TV special and album in 2001.\n\n5. **Music Videos**:
        There are two notable music videos for \"Hi, Hi, Hi\". The first was filmed
        at Southern TV studios in Northam, England, on November 25, 1972, and was
        first aired on the ITV TV program \"Russell Harty Plus\" on December 16, 1972.
        The second video, produced in 2001, combines footage from the 1976 live performance
        with scenes from the 1972 version and other videos.\n\n6. **Inclusion in Compilations**:
        \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" has been included on various Paul McCartney compilation albums,
        such as \"Wingspan: Hits and History\" (2001), \"Pure McCartney\" (2016),
        and as a bonus track on the reissues of \"Red Rose Speedway\" (1993 and 2018)."},
