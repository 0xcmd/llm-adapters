        0, "finish_reason": "stop", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Hi,
        Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings.
        Here are some key points about the song:\n\n1. **Release Date**: It was released
        as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" on December 1, 1972, in the UK and
        December 4, 1972, in the USA.\n\n2. **Chart Performance**: The single peaked
        at number one in Spain, number five in the United Kingdom, and number 10 in
        the United States in January 1973.\n\n3. **Ban**: The song was banned by the
        BBC in the UK due to its sexually suggestive lyrical content and the assumption
        that the title phrase \"We''re gonna get hi, hi, hi\" was a drug reference.
        Paul McCartney clarified that the lyrics were misunderstood, particularly
        the phrase \"get you ready for my polygon,\" which was interpreted as \"get
        you ready for my body gun\".\n\n4. **Live Performances**: The song became
        a staple of Wings'' live shows in the 1970s and was included in various compilation
        albums and reissues, such as \"Wingspan: Hits and History,\" \"Pure McCartney,\"
        and \"Red Rose Speedway\".\n\n5. **Music Videos**: There are multiple versions
        of the music video, including one restored from the \"Red Rose Speedway Archive
        Collection\" Bonus DVD and another produced by MPL as part of the promotion
        for the TV special and album \"Wingspan\" in 2001.\n\n6. **Recording Details**:
        The song was recorded at EMI Studios, Abbey Road, on September 20, 1972, and
        mixed on November 6, 1972.\n\n7. **Lyrics and Inspiration**: Paul McCartney
        wrote the song in a sensuous mood while in Spain. He intended the lyrics to
        be playful and not explicitly about drugs, but the song was still interpreted
        as such due to the cultural context of the time."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
