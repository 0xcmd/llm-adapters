        0, "finish_reason": "stop", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Hi,
        Hi, Hi\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings.
        Here are some key points about the song:\n\n1. **Release**: The song was released
        as a double A-side single with \"C Moon\" in December 1972.\n2. **Chart Performance**:
        It peaked at number one in Spain, number five in the United Kingdom, and number
        10 in the United States in January 1973.\n3. **Ban**: The song was banned
        by the BBC in the UK due to its sexually suggestive lyrical content and the
        assumption that the title phrase \"We''re gonna get hi, hi, hi\" was a drug
        reference. However, Paul McCartney clarified that the lyrics were about sex
        and not drugs, and that the BBC misinterpreted some of the words.\n4. **Recording**:
        The song was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in 1972.\n5. **Inclusion**:
        \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" has been included on various Paul McCartney compilation albums,
        such as \"Wingspan: Hits and History\" (2001), \"Pure McCartney\" (2016),
        and as a bonus track on the reissues of \"Red Rose Speedway\" (1993 and 2018).\n6.
        **Live Performances**: The song became a staple of Wings'' live shows in the
        1970s and was often introduced with the announcement that it was banned by
        the BBC, which added to its popularity.\n\nOverall, \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" is a glam
        rock song that was controversial at the time of its release due to its lyrics
        but has since become a well-known track in Wings'' discography."}, "delta":
