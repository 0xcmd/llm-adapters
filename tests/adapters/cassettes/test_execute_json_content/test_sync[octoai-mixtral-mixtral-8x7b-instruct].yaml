        How can I help you today? I''m here to answer any questions you have about
        computer science, programming, or technology in general. Let me know if there''s
        something specific you''d like to learn about.\n\nIn the meantime, here''s
        a fun fact: The first electronic computer, called the ENIAC, was built in
        1946 and weighed more than 27 tons! It had 17,468 vacuum tubes and could perform
        about 5,000 operations per second. Today''s computers are much smaller and
        more powerful, thanks to advancements in technology and the invention of the
        transistor and the integrated circuit."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":11,"completion_tokens":143,"total_tokens":154}}'
