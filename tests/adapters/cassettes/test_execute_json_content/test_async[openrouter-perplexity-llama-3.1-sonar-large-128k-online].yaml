        Hi, Hi\\\" is a song written by Paul and Linda McCartney, performed by Wings,
        and released in 1972. Here are some key points about the song:\\n\\n- **Release**:
        The song was released as a double A-side single with \\\"C Moon\\\" on December
        1, 1972, in the UK and December 4, 1972, in the USA.\\n- **Chart Performance**:
        The single peaked at number one in Spain, number five in the UK, and number
        ten in the USA in January 1973.\\n- **Recording**: The song was recorded at
        Abbey Road Studios in London during November 1972.\\n- **Genre**: It is classified
        as glam rock.\\n- **Ban by the BBC**: The song was banned by the BBC due to
        its sexually suggestive lyrics and a presumed drug reference in the title
        phrase \\\"We're gonna get hi, hi, hi\\\".\\n  - **Lyrics Misinterpretation**:
        Paul McCartney clarified that the lyrics were misinterpreted, with the phrase
        \\\"get you ready for my body gun\\\" being incorrect; he stated the correct
        lyrics were \\\"get you ready for my polygon\\\".\\n- **Live Performances**:
        \\\"Hi, Hi, Hi\\\" became a staple in Wings' live shows during the 1970s.\\n-
        **Inclusion in Compilations**: The song has been included in several compilation
        albums, such as \\\"Wingspan: Hits and History\\\" (2001), \\\"Red Rose Speedway\\\"
        reissues (1993 and 2018), and \\\"Pure McCartney\\\" (2016).\\n\\nThe song
        has also been featured in various video formats, including a restored version
        from the \\\"Red Rose Speedway Archive Collection\\\" Bonus DVD and a live
        version interspersed with other footage from the 1976 \\\"Wings Over America\\\"
        tour.\",\"refusal\":\"\"}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":3,\"completion_tokens\":399,\"total_tokens\":402}}"
