        seems like you''ve entered a JSON representation of two objects. JSON (short
        for JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that
        is typically used to transmit data between a server and a web application
        or client. The \"[object Object]\" part indicates that these are JavaScript
        objects, which can contain key-value pairs.\n\nFor example, these might look
        like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John\",\n  \"age\": 30,\n  \"city\": \"New
        York\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"id\": 1234,\n  \"title\": \"Manager\",\n  \"department\":
        \"Sales\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you need help with parsing or understanding these
