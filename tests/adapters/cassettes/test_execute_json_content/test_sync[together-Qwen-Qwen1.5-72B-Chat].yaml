        seems like you''ve pasted a JavaScript object or a JSON representation of
        objects. In JavaScript, `[object Object]` is how an object is represented
        when it''s converted to a string. If you have actual data you''d like me to
        help you with, please provide more details or the content inside the objects.
        For example, if you have two objects like:\n\n```javascript\nvar obj1 = {name:
        \"John\", age: 30};\nvar obj2 = {city: \"New York\", country: \"USA\"};\n```\n\nAnd
        you print them as strings, they would appear as `[object Object]`. If you
        want me to help with the data inside these objects, please share the properties
        and values, and I''ll be happy to assist."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":25,"completion_tokens":156,"total_tokens":181}}'
