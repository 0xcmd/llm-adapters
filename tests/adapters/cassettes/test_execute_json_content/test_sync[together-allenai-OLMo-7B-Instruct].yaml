        looks like you have two objects inside of another object. Here''s a breakdown

        data structure that can store key-value pairs. It can be created using the
        object literal syntax, like this: `{key1: value1, key2: value2}`.\n\n2. `[object
        Object]` is another object, which means it is a nested object. This nested
        object has no key-value pairs, so it is empty.\n\nIn summary, the nested object
