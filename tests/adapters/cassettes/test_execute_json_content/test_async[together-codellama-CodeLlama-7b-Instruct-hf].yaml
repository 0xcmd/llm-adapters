        seems like you are trying to pass an array of objects as an argument to a
        function, but the syntax is not correct.\n\nHere is an example of how you
        can pass an array of objects as an argument to a function:\n```\nfunction
        myFunction(arr) {\n  console.log(arr);\n}\n\nconst arr = [\n  { name: ''John'',
        age: 30 },\n  { name: ''Jane'', age: 25 }\n];\n\nmyFunction(arr);\n```\nIn
        this example, the `arr` variable is an array of objects, and it is passed
        as an argument to the `myFunction` function. The function will then log the
        array to the console.\n\nIf you are trying to pass an array of objects as
        an argument to a function, but you are getting an error, it may be because
        the array is not defined or because the function is not defined. Make sure
        that the array is defined and that the function is defined before you try
        to pass it as an argument."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":224,"total_tokens":240}}'
