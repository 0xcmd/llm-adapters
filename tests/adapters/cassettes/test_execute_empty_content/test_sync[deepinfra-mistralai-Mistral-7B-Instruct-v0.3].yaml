        I''m sorry for the delay in response. Here''s information on the complexity
        of a binary search algorithm:\n\nA binary search is a search algorithm used
        to find the position of an element within a sorted array. Compared to a linear
        search, the binary search algorithm is much more efficient for large, sorted
        arrays because it reduces the search space by eliminating half of the array
        to search in each step.\n\nThe time complexity of a binary search algorithm
        in the best-case scenario (when the target value is at the beginning of the
        array) is O(1), which means the search operation takes a constant amount of
        time. However, in the common case when the target value is somewhere in the
        array, the time complexity is O(log n), where n is the number of elements
        in the array.\n\nThe worst-case scenario occurs when the target value is either
        at the end of the array or not present in the array. In this case, the time
        complexity is also O(log n). Even though this is worse than other search algorithms
        like linear search in terms of the number of steps, it is still faster for
        large arrays due to the logarithmic time complexity.\n\nThe binary search
        algorithm has a space complexity of O(1) because the algorithm requires only
        a few additional variables to perform the search. This makes it an efficient
        algorithm for searching large amounts of data.\n\nOverall, the binary search
        algorithm is a powerful tool for finding an item in a sorted array quickly,
        and its time complexity is logarithmic, which makes it more efficient than
        linear search for large datasets.","name":null,"tool_calls":[]},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":9,"total_tokens":338,"completion_tokens":329,"estimated_cost":1.859e-05}}'
