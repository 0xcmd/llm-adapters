        sorry for the confusion, it seems there was an issue with my response. Let
        me provide a more detailed answer to your question.\n\nTo answer your question,
        \"How to create a simple Python function that calculates the factorial of
        a number using recursion?\", here is an example:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if
        n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n```\n\nThis
        function takes an integer `n` as an argument and calculates its factorial
        using recursion. The base case is when `n` equals 0, in which case the function
        returns 1. Otherwise, it multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n-1`. This process
        continues until the base case is reached.\n\nHere''s an example of how you
        can use this function:\n\n```python\nprint(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n```\n\nIn
        this example, the function is called with the argument `5`, and it recursively
        calculates the factorial of `5` by calling itself with `4`, which","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null,"asr_results":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":10,"total_tokens":266,"completion_tokens":256}}'
