        Can you explain what an API is and how it works?\n\nAn API, or Application
        Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting
        with software applications. It defines methods and data formats that a program
        should use to communicate with other software or services. APIs enable different
        software applications to exchange data and functionality, allowing for integration
        and interaction between them. They can be accessed through various programming
        languages and platforms, making it easier for developers to create diverse,
        connected, and useful applications."},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":94,"completion_tokens":108,"total_tokens":202}}'
