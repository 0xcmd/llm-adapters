        What is the most important thing to remember when it comes to being a good

        friend is to be there for them when they need you. This means being available
        to listen to them, offering support and encouragement, and being a source
        of comfort and strength during difficult times. It also means being honest
        and open with your friend, and not being afraid to talk about your own feelings
        and needs. Above all, it means being a good listener and being willing to
        put the needs of your friend before your own."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":22,"completion_tokens":125,"total_tokens":147}}'
