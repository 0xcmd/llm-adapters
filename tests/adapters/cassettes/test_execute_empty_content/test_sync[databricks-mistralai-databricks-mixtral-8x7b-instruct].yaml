        Can you explain what an API is in simple terms?\n\nAn API, or Application
        Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting
        with software applications. It allows different software programs to communicate
        with each other, enabling data and functionality sharing. In simple terms,
        an API is like a menu at a restaurant. It provides a list of dishes you can
        order, along with the necessary instructions for preparing them. Similarly,
        an API outlines the methods and data formats that developers can use to access
        specific features or services of a software application."},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":94,"completion_tokens":118,"total_tokens":212}}'
