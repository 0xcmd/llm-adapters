        How do I create a strong password?\n\nA strong password should be unique and
        complex to prevent unauthorized access. Here are some tips to create a strong
        password:\n\n* Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers,
        and special characters.\n* Make it at least 12 characters long.\n* Avoid using
        personal information, such as your name, birthdate, or common words.\n* Use
        a passphrase, which is a sequence of words that are meaningful to you but
        hard for others to guess.\n* Consider using a password manager to generate
        and store complex passwords securely.\n* Avoid reusing passwords across different
        accounts.\n\nRemember to avoid sharing your password with others and to change
        it regularly to maintain its strength."},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":94,"completion_tokens":161,"total_tokens":255}}'
