        Bumblebee Lament\n\nIn quiet glades I roam, a soul undone\nBy loss so deep,
        my heart is heavy, torn\nA bumblebee, once hale and strong and fun\nIs dead,
        his golden wings forever forlorn\n\nHe buzzed and hummed through fronds of
        green,\nA speck of color in a mundane scene\nBut now he''s gone, no more will
        he be seen\nIngreat sweeping arcs across the leafy scene\n\nOh wretched fate,
        to steal this joy away\nTo make a mystery of one bright day\nA baneful silence
        fills the air of May\n\nThe flowers have no buzzing words to say\nFor all
        their petals bravely hide their pain\nBut whisper secrets, quiet as a prayer,\nTo
        ask the heavens where their friend went afore\n\nThe caterpillars weep for
        those who care\nBut know no way to ease this aching despair\nThe worms beneath
        the earth are unmoved\nTheir secrets locked in shadows, thick and chilled\n\nI
        too must learn to bear the brunt of this\nThe pains of life that sometimes
        hit like a missile\nThe world will go on, a beauty never still\nNo matter
        how you wish, you''ll never feel\nA single moment''s lift, a pause, a cool
        babble\nA mix of joy and grief that seems to ruffle\nOur lives and leave us
        longing for a balm\nA solace small, but warmth we cling to like a charm\n\nBut
        let it be a lesson learned, dear heart\nThat life so cruel can also heal and
        start\nA bumblebee will live again, upon the wing\nWith love and hope the
        flowers begin to sing\n\nSo, let the quiet moments be your guide\nFor loving
        hearts and kindness, there''s no need to hide\nOn every leaf, on every flower
        you''ll find\nSome gift of life to soothe an aching mind\n\nAnd though the
        silence may still ring a toll\nThe seed of hope remains, a jewel untold\nIt
        waits not long, for that which seems so still\nTo nourish, grow and fill the
        emptiness with chill.\n\nThis ballad of loss so deep and sorrow\nReminds us:
        love can heal, in our tomorrow\nIn humming wings and secrets told in song\nDances
        life, with joy endless and strong.","name":null,"tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":9,"total_tokens":537,"completion_tokens":528,"estimated_cost":2.9535e-05}}'
