        I''m here to help with any questions or tasks you have, such as writing, coding,
        or explaining complex concepts. I can provide short responses to simple questions
        or more detailed answers to open-ended questions. I use markdown for code
        blocks and can work with JSON and tables. I don''t have real-time data access
        or code execution capabilities, and I avoid stereotypes and biased language.
        I also won''t provide song lyrics, poems, or news articles, and I won''t divulge
        details of my training data. How can I assist you today?\n\nHere''s an example
        of how I can help with coding:\n\n```python\n# This is a simple Python function
        that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest prime number in the list\ndef
        largest_prime(numbers):\n    def is_prime(n):\n        if n < 2:\n            return
        False\n        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i ==
        0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    primes = [num
        for num in numbers if is_prime(num)]\n    if primes:\n        return max(primes)\n    else:\n        return
        None\n```\n\nAnd here''s an example of how I can help with explaining a complex
        concept:\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that
        aims to create machines that mimic or surpass human intelligence. This can
        include tasks such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and language
        understanding. AI can be divided into two main categories: narrow or weak
        AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, and general or strong AI,
        which can perform any intellectual task that a human can do. AI has many potential
        applications, including self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, and customer
        service chatbots. However, it also raises ethical and societal concerns, such
        as job displacement and bias in decision-making."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":234,"total_tokens":614,"completion_tokens":380}}'
