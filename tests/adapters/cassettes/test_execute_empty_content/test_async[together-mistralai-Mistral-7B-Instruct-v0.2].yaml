        I see you haven''t provided any context or question for me to answer. Here''s
        a general response to the blank line:\n\nA blank line is a line that contains
        no characters or text. In programming and text editing, a blank line is used
        to add space and make the code or text easier to read. In mathematics, a blank
        line can represent the absence of a value or the continuation of a proof or
        equation on the next line. In everyday language, a blank line can represent
        a pause or a moment of silence."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":22,"completion_tokens":112,"total_tokens":134}}'
