        outcomes are measurable goals of a learning activity. They describe what a
        student should be able to know, understand, or be able to demonstrate upon
        completion of a learning activity. In other words, they identify the skills,
        knowledge, and attitudes that a student is expected to acquire. \n\nA well-written
        learning outcome typically includes three components:\n\n1. The Condition:
        This describes the condition under which the student will achieve the outcome,
        such as \"Given a math word problem\".\n2. The Behavior: This describes the
        action the student must take to achieve the outcome, such as \"Demonstrate
        understanding of word problems related to addition, subtraction, multiplication,
        and division\".\n3. The Criterion: This describes the specific level of performance
        the student must meet to achieve the outcome, such as \"Solve at least 80%
        of a set of math word problems correctly within 10 minutes.\"\n\nA typical
        example of a well-written learning outcome for a math word problem is:\n\n\"Given
        a math word problem, students will demonstrate understanding of word problems
        related to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by solving
        at least 80% of a set of math word problems correctly within 10 minutes.\"\n\nThis
        learning outcome specifies the condition (given a math word problem) and the
        behavior (solving the problem), and sets a criterion for success (at least
        80% of problems solved correctly within 10 minutes). This allows educators
        to assess the student''s progress towards achieving the outcome and adjust
        their teaching strategies if needed to help students meet the criterion."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":19,"completion_tokens":306,"total_tokens":325}}'
