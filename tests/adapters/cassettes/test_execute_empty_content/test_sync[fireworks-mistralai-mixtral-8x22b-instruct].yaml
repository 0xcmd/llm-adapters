        Insufficient Fee \n\nThe \"Instruction: Insufficient Fee\" error message is
        generated when attempting to process a blockchain transaction and the required
        transaction fee is not met. This error is common in blockchain systems where
        a certain amount of fee is expected for every transaction that is processed
        on the blockchain.\n\nIn the provided example, the transaction instruction,
        [INST] 0xbb5a23a6, specifies the operation to be performed, in this case likely
        a transfer of some sort. In the [BLESS] section of the instruction, a timestamp
        is provided, which was 2312 in this case, and there''s an \"Insufficient Fee\"
        error in the [DEST] section, indicating that the transaction was not sent
        to its specified destination due to the insufficient fee.\n\nTo resolve this
        error, the sender would need to increase the included fee so that it meets
        the required minimum for the specific blockchain platform they are using.
        The \"Data\" section of the transaction, indicated as the section following
        [DATA] and ending with 0x000000000000000000000000000000d7, provides more information
        about the specifics of the transaction such as the recipient''s address, amount
        being transferred, and other relevant data.\n\nTo avoid this error in future
        transactions, ensure that the provided fee is greater than or equal to the
        minimum set fee for the blockchain platform being used. The fee should also
        be adjusted to reflect the size of the Data or the complexity of the transaction."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"total_tokens":473,"completion_tokens":461}}'
