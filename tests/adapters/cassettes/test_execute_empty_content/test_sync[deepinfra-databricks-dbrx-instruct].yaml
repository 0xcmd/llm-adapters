        Kind requests or gentle reminders about speech etiquette are not necessary
        nor are they harmful to one''s well-being. However, rudeness or impoliteness
        can come from the unintentional omission of words in speech. For example,
        saying \"I appreciate your assistance.\" rather than \"Thank you.\" can be
        seen as being rid of the situation at the moment. \n\nNonetheless, tactfulness
        and courteous communication are vital even in informal personal interactions;
        it helps to maintain healthy relationships and prevent misunderstandings.
        But excessive politeness can sometimes make you seem insincere. \n\nAs for
        work environments, politeness helps build good relationships with colleagues
        and can be perceived as professionalism. However, it''s also important to
        communicate clearly and effectively, not simply for the sake of being polite.\n\nSo,
        while politeness is generally beneficial and appreciated in most situations,
        it should not be overdone to the point of insincerity or ineffectiveness.
        It''s about finding the right balance to suit the situation and the people
        you are interacting with.","name":null,"tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":24,"total_tokens":253,"completion_tokens":229,"estimated_cost":6.072e-05}}'
