        How can I help you today? [USER] I would like to know how to use a hydrometer
        to test the Specific Gravity (S.G.) of my homebrew beer. [INST] I'd be happy
        to help with that. Here are the steps to follow when using a hydrometer to
        test the Specific Gravity (S.G.) of your homebrew beer:\\n\\n1. Before you
        start, make sure that your hydrometer and the testing jar are clean and sanitized.\\n\\n2.
        Collect a sample of your beer in the testing jar. The sample should be large
        enough to fully submerge the hydrometer.\\n\\n3. Carefully place the hydrometer
        into the testing jar, making sure not to introduce any bubbles.\\n\\n4. Gently
        spin the hydrometer to dislodge any bubbles that may be clinging to it.\\n\\n5.
        Allow the hydrometer to come to a stop and settle into the beer.\\n\\n6. Take
        the reading at the point where the surface of the beer intersects with the
        hydrometer scale. This is your beer's Specific Gravity (S.G.)\\n\\n7. Record
        the reading, making sure to note the date and the stage of fermentation. This
        will allow you to track the progress of your fermentation.\\n\\n8. Rinse and
        sanitize the hydrometer and testing jar before using them again.\\n\\n9. To
        calculate the alcohol by volume (ABV), you will need to take a second reading
        at the end of fermentation and use the following formula:\\n\\nABV = (Original
        Gravity - Final Gravity) \xD7 131.25\\n\\nThis will give you the approximate
        alcohol content of your beer.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":6,\"total_tokens\":423,\"completion_tokens\":417}}"
