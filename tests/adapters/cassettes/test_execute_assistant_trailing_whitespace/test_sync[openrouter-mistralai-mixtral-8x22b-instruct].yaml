        everyone, welcome to the first Fire Emblem Heroes community update of June!
        In this update, we'll discuss the details about the June 3 update and the
        upcoming Voting Gauntlet. Additionally, we'll go over some miscellaneous news
        and events occurring in June.\\n\\n[Featured Hero]\\n\\nDuring the June 3
        update, we will be getting a new Legendary Hero, Eliwood: Marquess Pherae!\\n\\nLegendary
        Eliwood will be a colorless infantry lance unit. In his base kit, he comes
        with the following skills:\\n\\n- Enduring Breath (Special): CD count-2 after
        this unit initiates combat and foe cannot counterattack. Cooldown charge +1
        per attack suffered by this unit during combat with a dragonstone effective
        against dragons, before and after combat, regardless of whether it was a counterattack
        or the unit was damaged by other means.\\n- Mirror Impact (Specia): Boosts
        damage dealt by 60% of unit's Def. If unit initiates combat, unit can make
        a follow-up attack before foe can counterattack and foe cannot make a follow-up
        attack.\\n- Atk/Spd Push 4 (A slot): Grants Atk/Spd+7 during combat while
        unit's HP \u2265 25%. After combat, deals 5 damage to unit.\\n- Dull Ranged
        3 (B slot): Disables foe's skills that guarantee foe\u2019s follow-up attack
        and foe's skills that prevent unit's follow-up attack during combat.\\n- Rouse
        Atk/Spd 4 (C slot): Grants Atk/Spd+6 to unit and adjacent allies for 1 turn
        after combat.\\n- Ground Orders 3 (C slot, ally support): Infantry and flying
        allies within 2 spaces can move to a space within 2 spaces of unit. (This
        skill does not stack with similar skills.)\u200B\\n\\nUnfortunately, Legendary
        Eliwood's refine has not been revealed yet.\\n\\n[Update]\\n\\nThe June 3
        update will also bring along the following:\\n- The Aether Raids and Allegiance
        Battles maps will be updated. Aether Raids will also receive its monthly map
        rotation.\\n- New weapon skills and weapons to refine will be added.\\n- A
        new event calendar will be released, detailing all of the events happening
        in June.\\n\\n[Voting Gauntlet]\\n\\nThe 26th Voting Gauntlet, titled \\\"Rival
        Realms,\\\" will begin on June 11 at 12:00am PT! The participating heroes
        are as follows:\\n\\n- Round 1: Edelgard vs Claude\\n- Round 2: Ophelia vs
        Flora\\n- Round 3: Lethe vs Kaden\\n- Finals: The winner of Edelgard vs Claude
        will face off against the winner of either Ophelia vs Flora or Lethe vs Kaden.\\n\\nThe
        event will follow the structure of previous Voting Gauntlets:\\n\\n- During
        each round, players may participate in battles to earn points for the winning
        team.\\n- Battle wins will be counted as points. If you lose a battle, no
        points will be deducted.\\n- You can spend Battle Flags to multiply your score
        in a single battle (you'll start with one and can earn more through quests
        or by obtaining them as rewards).\\n\\nAs always, the winning team of each
        round will proceed to the next round, and the final victor will be crowned
        once the event concludes. There will also be quests to complete during the
        event, and the results of the Voting Gauntlet will determine the bonus units
        for each round.\\n\\n[Miscellaneous]\\n\\nHere are some other events and updates
        to look forward to in June:\\n\\n- A new Mythic Hero is expected to be released
        near the end of June.\\n- We can expect the Tempest Trials+ event to return
        towards the middle of the month.\\n- We will most likely receive new Grand
        Hero Battles, Heroic Grail challenges, and weekly quests.\\n- The next Legendary
        Hero will be released at the very end of the month (usually on the last day).\\n-
        The Legendary Hero Battle revival will take place from around June 17 to June
        22.\\n- We can expect to see new special maps and log-in bonuses throughout
        the month.\\n- There's also a chance we might see the release of Book V, especially
        since the last chapter of Book IV was released in January.\\n\\nKeep an eye
        on the in-game notifications for the exact dates and times for these events
        and updates!\\n\\n[Closing]\\n\\nThat's all for the June 3 update and the
        upcoming Voting Gauntlet! We hope you're as excited as we are for all the
        new content and events that will be happening in June. Be sure to log in to
        Fire Emblem Heroes to check out the new Legendary Hero, Eliwood, and prepare

        Heroes!\\n\\n\",\"refusal\":\"\"}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":10,\"completion_tokens\":1150,\"total_tokens\":1160}}"
