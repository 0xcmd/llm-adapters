        query seems to be about quotes related to the concept of \"empty.\" Here are
        some key points and quotes from the provided sources:\n\n1. **Book Quotes**:\n   -
        **C. S. Lewis**: \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing,
        the joy of life is unfurled.\" This quote highlights the idea that even in
        emptiness, there can be a profound sense of joy and life.\n   - **Neil Gaiman**:
        \"All alone, in the middle of the night, Coraline began to cry. There was
        no other sound in the empty flat.\" This quote captures the loneliness and
        isolation that can come with emptiness.\n   - **Lao Tzu**: \"By emptying their
        hearts And filling their bellies, Weakening their intelligence And toughening
        their sinews Ever striving to make the people knowledgeless and desireless.\"
        This quote from the Tao Te Ching discusses the concept of emptiness in a philosophical
        context, suggesting that it can lead to a state of simplicity and lack of
        desire.\n\n2. **General Quotes**:\n   - **Antonio Porchia**: \"In a full heart
        there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there is room for nothing.\"
        This quote emphasizes the contrast between fullness and emptiness, suggesting
        that a full heart is more capable of embracing life.\n   - **Lao Tzu**: \"Empty
        your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of
        beings, but contemplate their return. Each separate being in the universe
        returns to the common source.\" This quote encourages a state of mental emptiness
        as a path to peace and understanding.\n\nThese quotes provide various perspectives
        on the concept of \"empty,\" ranging from emotional and psychological to philosophical
        and spiritual. They suggest that emptiness can be both a source of suffering
        and a path to growth and understanding."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
