        provide a comprehensive overview of quotes about \"empty,\" here are some
        key points and quotes from various sources:\n\n1. **Philosophical and Spiritual
        Perspectives**:\n   - **Lao Tzu** emphasizes the importance of emptying one''s
        mind to find peace and serenity. \"Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your
        heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return.
        Each separate being in the universe returns to the common source. Returning
        to the source is serenity.\"\n   - **Liu Yiming** discusses the concept of
        true emptiness and its relation to existence. \"True emptiness is like the
        inner openness of a bell or a drum; ineffable existence is like the sounding
        of a bell or a drum when struck.\"\n\n2. **Literary Insights**:\n   - **C.
        S. Lewis** highlights the joy that can emerge from emptiness. \"Into the void
        of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\"\n   -
        **Neil Gaiman** portrays the emotional impact of emptiness in his novel \"Coraline.\"
        \"All alone, in the middle of the night, Coraline began to cry. There was
        no other sound in the empty flat.\"\n\n3. **Personal Growth and Emptiness**:\n   -
        **Ellen Hopkins** suggests that emptiness can be liberating. \"Empty is the
        perfect state of being. Nothing inside to anchor you. Nothing inside to chain
        you down, keep you from living your dreams.\"\n   - **Mehmet Murat ildan**
        encourages adding value to empty spaces. \"Wherever you see an empty life,
        or an empty page or an empty mind, add something good to it!\"\n\n4. **Empty
        Nest Syndrome**:\n   - **Erma Bombeck** humorously addresses the transition
        to an empty nest. \"When mothers talk about the depression of the empty nest,
        they\u2019re not mourning the passing of all those wet towels on the floor,
        or the music that numbs your teeth, or even the bottle of capless shampoo
        dribbling down the shower drain. They\u2019re upset because they\u2019ve gone
        from supervisor of a child\u2019s life to a spectator.\"\n   - **Joyce Maynard**
        emphasizes the importance of personal growth during this phase. \"It''s not
        only children who grow. Parents do too. As much as we watch to see what our
        children do with their lives, they are watching us to see what we do with
        ours.\"\n\nThese quotes offer a range of perspectives on the concept of \"empty,\"
        from philosophical and spiritual insights to literary and personal reflections."},
