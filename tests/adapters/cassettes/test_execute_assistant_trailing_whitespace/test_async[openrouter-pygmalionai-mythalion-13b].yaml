        Instruction:\\nCan you come up with an emotional analysis for the following?\\n\\nGuillaume
        is very stressed - he has so much school work, and it is piling up. He feels
        that he can't catch up and keeps postponing the work for later, but the deadlines
        keep getting closer. He is also losing sleep at night due to his anxiety.
        He knows he needs to find a solution soon or else he will fail his classes.\\n\\n###
        Response:\\n Guillaume is feeling anxiety, stress and overwhelm. He is stuck
        in a cycle of procrastination and fear, which is causing him to lose sleep
        and feel unable to cope with the growing workload. His stress levels are high
        as he feels like he is drowning inassignments. He is also worried about failing
        his classes, which adds a sense of urgency to the situation. Guillaume might
        benefit from setting a plan, prioritizing tasks, breaking them down, and seeking
        help from teachers or mentors if necessary. He needs to find ways to manage
        his time better and develop healthy study habits in order to alleviate his
        stress and regain control of the situation.\",\"refusal\":\"\"}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":39,\"completion_tokens\":254,\"total_tokens\":293}}"
