        Here are some relevant quotes from various sources:\n\n1. **C.S. Lewis**:
        \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life
        is unfurled.\" - This quote highlights the idea that even in emptiness, there
        can be joy and life.\n\n2. **Neil Gaiman**: \"All alone, in the middle of
        the night, Coraline began to cry. There was no other sound in the empty flat.\"
        - This quote captures the feeling of isolation and emptiness.\n\n3. **Lao
        Tzu**: \"By emptying their hearts And filling their bellies, Weakening their
        intelligence And toughening their sinews Ever striving to make the people
        knowledgeless and desireless.\" - This quote discusses the concept of emptying
        oneself for a purpose.\n\n4. **Arnold Lobel**: \"No one has ever sent me a
        letter. Every day my mailbox is empty. That is why waiting for the mail is
        a sad time for me.\" - This quote illustrates the feeling of emptiness and
        longing.\n\n5. **Waylon H. Lewis**: \"I am a lover of love and I am a lover
        of words, and the two together spin visions of airy castles, but also may
        pierce the heart of hope. And so I remind you that I am a fool, a poet, and
        what matters is reality, not lovely words. Words are full of promise, yet
        empty of matter.\" - This quote reflects on the emptiness of words without
        substance.\n\n6. **Judith Kerr**: \"Sophie found she couldn\u2019t have her
        bath because the tiger had drunk all the water in the tap.\" - This quote
        shows how an empty resource (water) can cause inconvenience.\n\n7. **Jean
        Craighead George**: \"The wind blew across the water, shattering the tips
        of the waves and shooting ice-sparklets north with the storm. \u2018Kapugen!\u2019
        she called. No one answered. Kapugen was gone. The earth was empty and bleak.\"
        - This quote describes a scene of emptiness and desolation.\n\n8. **Robert
        Louis Stevenson**: \"At the Seaside When I was down beside the sea A wooden
        spade they gave to me To dig the sandy shore, My holes were empty like a cup,
        In every hole the sea came up Till it could come no more\" - This quote uses
        imagery to describe the emptiness of holes dug in the sand.\n\n9. **Constance
        Heward**: \"Ameliar-anne seemed to be terribly hungry, for her plate was nearly
        always empty...\u201d - This quote illustrates the constant feeling of emptiness
        and hunger.\n\n10. **Feeling Empty Quote**: \u201cFeeling empty is the invitation
        to refill your soul with whatever brings you joy and a sense of purpose.\u201d
        - This quote emphasizes the need to fill emptiness with meaningful activities.\n\nThese
