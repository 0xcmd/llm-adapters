        seems like your query is incomplete. However, if you''re looking for quotes
        about emptiness or empty nest syndrome, here are some relevant quotes and
        insights:\n\n### Quotes on Emptiness\n\n1. **\"Empty is the perfect state
        of being. Nothing inside to anchor you. Nothing inside to chain you down,
        keep you from living your dreams.\"** - Ellen Hopkins\n\n2. **\"Into the void
        of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\"**
        - C. S. Lewis\n\n3. **\"In a full heart there is room for everything, and
        in an empty heart there is room for nothing.\"** - Antonio Porchia\n\n4. **\"The
        empty mind - the pure mind - is not a blank, zero-land, where you''re not
        feeling or caring about anything. It''s an effulgence of the mind. It''s a
        brightness that is truly sensitive and accepting.\"** - Unknown\n\n### Quotes
        on Empty Nest Syndrome\n\n1. **\"The greatest burden a child must bear is
        the unlived life of the parents.\"** - Carl Jung\n\n2. **\"Give the ones you
        love away, and keep the ones that love you in return.\"** - Unknown\n\n3.
        **\"When mothers talk about the depression of the empty nest, they\u2019re
        not mourning the passing of all those wet towels on the floor, or the music
        that numbs your teeth, or even the bottle of capless shampoo dribbling down
        the shower drain. They\u2019re upset because they\u2019ve gone from supervisor
        of a child\u2019s life to a spectator. It\u2019s like being the vice president
        of the United States.\"** - Erma Bombeck\n\n4. **\"Our children\u2019s independence
        is a reminder of how much we had to give and all that we have accomplished.
        It is a pleasure to remember that it is not a form of abandonment but an expression
        of a job well done.\"** - Unknown\n\n5. **\"I diagnosed my loneliness as premature
        empty nest syndrome.\"** - Kristen Schaal\n\nThese quotes capture various
        aspects of emptiness and the transition to an empty nest, offering insights
        into both the spiritual and emotional dimensions of these experiences."},
