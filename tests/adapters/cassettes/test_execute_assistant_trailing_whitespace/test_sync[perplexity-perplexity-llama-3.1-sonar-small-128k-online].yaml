        seems like your query is incomplete. However, if you are looking for quotes
        about empty nest syndrome, here are some relevant ones:\n\n### Funny Empty
        Nest Syndrome Quotes\n1. **\u201cHey empty nest parents, if you want your
        kid to call you, just change your Netflix password.\u201d** - Unknown\n2.
        **\u201cWhen mothers talk about the depression of the empty nest, they\u2019re
        not mourning the passing of all those wet towels on the floor, or the music
        that numbs your teeth, or even the bottle of capless shampoo dribbling down
        the shower drain. They\u2019re upset because they\u2019ve gone from supervisor
        of a child\u2019s life to a spectator. It\u2019s like being the vice president
        of the United States.\u201d** - Erma Bombeck\n3. **\u201cI don\u2019t like
        the term empty nesters. I prefer \u2018parents of free range adults\u2019.\u201d**
        - Robin Fox\n4. **\u201cIf the nest is truly empty, who owns all this junk?\u201d**
        - Erma Bombeck\n\n### Comforting Empty Nest Syndrome Quotes\n1. **\u201cI
        think that the best thing we can do for our children is to allow them to do
        things for themselves, allow them to be strong, allow them to experience life
        on their own terms, allow them to take the subway...let them be better people,
        let them believe more in themselves.\u201d** - C. JoyBell C.\n2. **\u201cOur
        children\u2019s independence is a reminder of how much we had to give and
        all that we have accomplished. It is a pleasure to remember that it is not
        a form of abandonment but an expression of a job well done.\u201d** - Unknown\n\n###
        Inspiring Empty Nest Syndrome Quotes\n1. **\u201cThe greatest burden a child
        must bear is the unlived life of the parents.\u201d** - Carl Jung\n2. **\u201cGive
        the ones you love wings to fly, roots to come back, reasons to stay.\u201d**
        - Dalai Lama\n3. **\u201cIt''s not only children who grow. Parents do too.
        As much as we watch to see what our children do with their lives, they are
        watching us to see what we do with ours. I can\u2019t tell my children to
        reach for the sun. All I can do is reach for it myself.\u201d** - Joyce Maynard\n\nIf
