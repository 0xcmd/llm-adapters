        to cry. There was no other sound in the empty flat.\" - **Coraline**\n\n2.
        **Laurie Halse Anderson** - \"This closet is abandoned - it has no purpose,
        no name. It is the perfect place for me.\" - **Speak**\n\n3. **C. S. Lewis**
        - \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of
        life is unfurled.\" - **C.S. Lewis Quotes about Joy**\n\n4. **Arnold Lobel**
        - \"No one has ever sent me a letter. Every day my mailbox is empty. That
        is why waiting for the mail is a sad time for me.\" - **Frog and Toad Are
        Friends**\n\n5. **Lao Tzu** - \"By emptying their hearts And filling their
        bellies, Weakening their intelligence And toughening their sinews Ever striving
        to make the people knowledgeless and desireless.\" - **Tao Te Ching**\n\n6.
        **Jean Craighead George** - \"The wind blew across the water, shattering the
        tips of the waves and shooting ice-sparklets north with the storm. \u2018Kapugen!\u2019

        a poet, and what matters is reality, not lovely words. Words are full of promise,
        yet empty of matter.\" - **Things I Would Like To Do With You**\n\n8. **Judith

        A wooden spade they gave to me To dig the sandy shore, My holes were empty
        like a cup, In every hole the sea came up Till it could come no more\" - **A
        Child''s Garden of Verses**\n\n10. **Constance Heward** - \"Ameliar-anne seemed
        to be terribly hungry, for her plate was nearly always empty...\" - **Ameliaranne
        and the Green Umbrella**\n\n### Additional Context\n\nIf you have a specific
