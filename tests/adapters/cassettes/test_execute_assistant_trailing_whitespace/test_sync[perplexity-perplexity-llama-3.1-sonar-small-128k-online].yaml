        seems like you might be looking for quotes related to the concept of \"empty\"
        or perhaps something specific like \"empty nest syndrome.\" Here are some
        relevant quotes from the sources provided:\n\n### Empty Quotes\n1. **\"In
        a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there is
        room for nothing.\"** - Antonio Porchia\n2. **\"Empty is the perfect state
        of being. Nothing inside to anchor you. Nothing inside to chain you down,
        keep you from living your dreams.\"** - Ellen Hopkins\n3. **\"The empty mind
        - the pure mind - is not a blank, zero-land, where you''re not feeling or
        caring about anything. It''s an effulgence of the mind. It''s a brightness
        that is truly sensitive and accepting.\"** - Unknown\n\n### Empty Nest Syndrome
        Quotes\n1. **\"The greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of
        the parents.\"** - Carl Jung\n2. **\"Give the ones you love wings to fly,
        roots to come back, reasons to stay.\"** - Dalai Lama\n3. **\"It''s not only
        children who grow. Parents do too. As much as we watch to see what our children
        do with their lives, they are watching us to see what we do with ours.\"**
        - Joyce Maynard\n\nThese quotes cover a range of themes related to emptiness
        and the transition of children leaving home. If you have a specific context
        or theme in mind, please let me know for more tailored suggestions."}, "delta":
