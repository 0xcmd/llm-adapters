        are you today?  |\n\n| AI | I''m just a computer program, so I don''t have
        feelings, but I''m here to help you with any questions or problems you might
        have. How can I assist you today?  |\n\n| Human | I have a question about
        the difference between a matrix and a vector. Can you explain that to me?  |\n\n|
        AI | Sure! A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers, while a matrix
        is a two-dimensional array of numbers. In other words, a vector has only rows
        or columns, while a matrix has both rows and columns. Vectors are often used
        to represent physical quantities such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration,
        while matrices are used to represent systems of linear equations, transformations,
        and other mathematical operations. |\n\n| Human | What are some examples of
        matrices and vectors?  |\n\n| AI | Here are some examples:\n\n* A vector could
        be represented as [3, 4], which represents a displacement of 3 units in the
        x-direction and 4 units in the y-direction.\n* A matrix could be represented
        as:\n\n```\n1 2","tool_calls":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","audio":null,"asr_results":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":10,"total_tokens":266,"completion_tokens":256}}'
