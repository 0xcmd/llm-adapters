        provide a comprehensive answer, it seems like you''re looking for quotes about
        the concept of \"empty.\" Here are some key points and quotes from the provided
        sources:\n\n1. **Philosophical and Spiritual Perspectives**:\n   - **Lao Tzu**
        emphasizes the importance of emptying one''s heart and mind to achieve a state
        of serenity and understanding. \"By emptying their hearts And filling their
        bellies, Weakening their intelligence And toughening their sinews Ever striving
        to make the people knowledgeless and desireless.\"\n   - **Liu Yiming** discusses
        the concept of true emptiness and its relation to existence, suggesting that
        true emptiness allows for responsiveness and serenity. \"True emptiness is
        like the inner openness of a bell or a drum; ineffable existence is like the
        sounding of a bell or a drum when struck.\"\n   - **C. JoyBell C.** talks
        about the need to stay grounded and not get caught up in empty, static energy.
        \"We have magical moments of connection with people, with nature, with Spirit,
        but then we rush out of those moments all too fast, in order to go straight
        back into the busy lanes that are full of things not worthwhile Empty energies!\"\n\n2.
        **Literary Insights**:\n   - **C.S. Lewis** suggests that emptiness can be
        a space where joy and life unfold. \"Into the void of silence, into the empty
        space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\"\n   - **Neil Gaiman** uses
        emptiness to evoke a sense of isolation and fear. \"All alone, in the middle
        of the night, Coraline began to cry. There was no other sound in the empty
        flat.\"\n   - **Jean Craighead George** describes a bleak and empty landscape
        after a character''s departure. \"The wind blew across the water, shattering
        the tips of the waves and shooting ice-sparklets north with the storm. \u2018Kapugen!\u2019
        she called. No one answered. Kapugen was gone. The earth was empty and bleak.\"\n\n3.
        **Psychological and Emotional Aspects**:\n   - **Yasmin Mogahed** highlights
        how humans struggle with emptiness and seek to fill it. \"They say you don\u2019t
        get over someone until you find someone or something better. As humans, we
        don\u2019t deal well with emptiness. Any empty space must be filled. Immediately.
        The pain of emptiness is too strong.\"\n   - **Craig D. Lounsbrough** reflects
        on how emptiness can result from focusing on things other than what truly
        fulfills us. \"If I scan the expanse of my heart and find it empty of everything
        except emptiness, it is because I \u2018poured\u2019 the whole of my passion
        into something other than God. And anything other than God will always be
        too \u2018poor\u2019 to be able to \u2018pour\u2019 back anything that can
        fill that kind of emptiness.\"\n\nThese quotes offer a variety of perspectives
        on the concept of \"empty,\" ranging from philosophical and spiritual insights
        to literary and psychological explorations."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
