        seems like you''re looking for quotes about feeling empty or the concept of
        emptiness. Here are some insightful quotes from the provided sources:\n\n1.
        **Focus on Growth**:\n   - \"If you focus on the hurt, you will continue to
        suffer. If you focus on the lesson, you will continue to grow.\"\n\n2. **Refilling
        Your Soul**:\n   - \"Feeling empty is the invitation to refill your soul with
        whatever brings you joy and a sense of purpose.\"\n\n3. **Emptiness and Fulfillment**:\n   -
        \"In a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there
        is room for nothing.\" - Antonio Porchia\n\n4. **Acceptance and Serenity**:\n   -
        \"Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil
        of beings, but contemplate their return. Each separate being in the universe
        returns to the common source. Returning to the source is serenity.\"\n\n5.
        **Finding Joy in Emptiness**:\n   - \"Into the void of silence, into the empty
        space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\" - C. S. Lewis\n\nThese quotes
        offer different perspectives on emptiness, from seeing it as an opportunity
        for growth and refilling one''s soul, to understanding it as a state that
        contrasts with fullness and serenity. They encourage reflection on how to
        find joy and peace even in moments of emptiness."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
