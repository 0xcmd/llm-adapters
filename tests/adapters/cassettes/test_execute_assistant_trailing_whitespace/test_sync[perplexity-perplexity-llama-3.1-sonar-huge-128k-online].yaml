        seems like you''re looking for quotes about empty nest syndrome. Here are
        some key points and quotes from the first source:\n\n1. **Funny Quotes**:\n   -
        **Changing Netflix Password**: \"Hey empty nest parents, if you want your
        kid to call you, just change your Netflix password.\" - Unknown\n   - **Supervisor
        to Spectator**: \"When mothers talk about the depression of the empty nest,
        they\u2019re not mourning the passing of all those wet towels on the floor,
        or the music that numbs your teeth, or even the bottle of capless shampoo
        dribbling down the shower drain. They\u2019re upset because they\u2019ve gone
        from supervisor of a child\u2019s life to a spectator.\" - Erma Bombeck\n   -
        **Free Range Adults**: \"I don\u2019t like the term empty nesters. I prefer
        \u2018parents of free range adults\u2019.\" - Robin Fox\n\n2. **Comforting
        Quotes**:\n   - **Allowing Independence**: \"I think that the best thing we
        can do for our children is to allow them to do things for themselves, allow
        them to be strong, allow them to experience life on their own terms, allow
        them to take the subway...let them be better people, let them believe more
        in themselves.\" - C. JoyBell C.\n   - **Job Well Done**: \"Our children\u2019s
        independence is a reminder of how much we had to give and all that we have
        accomplished. It is a pleasure to remember that it is not a form of abandonment
        but an expression of a job well done.\" - Unknown\n\n3. **Inspiring Quotes**:\n   -
        **Unlived Life**: \"The greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life
        of the parents.\" - Carl Jung\n   - **Reaching for the Sun**: \"It''s not
        only children who grow. Parents do too. As much as we watch to see what our
        children do with their lives, they are watching us to see what we do with
        ours. I can\u2019t tell my children to reach for the sun. All I can do is
        reach for it myself.\" - Joyce Maynard\n\n4. **Sad Quotes**:\n   - **Letting
        Go**: \"As a parent, you quickly realize that life is one long series of letting
        go: watching your kid crawl, then walk, then run, and then drive away.\" -
        Deborah Mitchell\n   - **Center of Your Life**: \"Empty nest is not just about
        the loud quiet. It\u2019s about being at the center of your own life where
        your kids used to be. You\u2019ll be encouraged to embrace your freedom, go
        back to school, volunteer, but coming first again is not as easy as it sounds.
        It feels like wearing shoes on the wrong feet.\" - Susan Bonifant\n\nThese
        quotes provide a range of perspectives on empty nest syndrome, from humorous
        to comforting, inspiring, and touching."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
