        seems like you''re looking for information on how to keep quotes around empty
        cells when saving a CSV file, particularly in LibreOffice. Here''s a summary
        based on the relevant search result:\n\n1. **LibreOffice Limitation**: Currently,
        LibreOffice does not have a standard option to quote empty cells when exporting
        to CSV. The \"Quote all text cells\" option in the export settings does not
        apply to empty cells.\n\n2. **Workaround**: To quote empty cells, you need
        to explicitly create empty text for those cells using the formula `=\"\"`.
        This can be done manually or through a script that replaces empty cells with
        this formula within a specified range. Here is a sample script provided in
        the discussion:\n\n```vb\nSub efficientPrepareUsedAreaOfSheetForFullyQuotedCSVexport(Optional
        pSheet)\n    If IsMissing(pSheet) Then pSheet = ThisComponent.CurrentController.ActiveSheet\n    cellCursor
        = pSheet.createCursor()\n    cellCursor.gotoStartOfUsedArea(False)\n    cellCursor.gotoEndOfUsedArea(True)\n    emptyRgs
        = cellCursor.queryEmptyCells()\n    For Each emptyRg In emptyRgs\n        ra
        = emptyRg.RangeAddress\n        With ra\n            topRow = emptyRg.SpreadSheet.getCellRangeByPosition(
        _\n                .StartColumn, .StartRow, .EndColumn, .StartRow)\n            topLeftCell
        = topRow.getCellByPosition(0, 0)\n        End With\n        topLeftCell.Formula
        = \"=\"\"\"\"\"\n        topRow.fillAuto(1, 1)\n        emptyRg.fillAuto(0,
        1)\n    Next emptyRg\nEnd Sub\n```\n\nThis script identifies empty cells within
        the used area of a sheet and fills them with the formula `=\"\"`, ensuring
        they are quoted when exported to CSV.\n\n3. **Alternative Approach**: Another
        user suggests checking the exported CSV file for commas without preceding
        quotes and inserting double quotes via JavaScript as a workaround. However,
        having an option in LibreOffice would be more consistent and convenient.\n\nIn
        summary, to keep quotes around empty cells in a CSV file using LibreOffice,
        you need to use a workaround such as filling empty cells with the formula
        `=\"\"` either manually or through a script."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
