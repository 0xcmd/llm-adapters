        you are looking for quotes related to the concept of \"empty\" or \"emptiness,\"
        here are some insightful and varied options:\n\n## On Emotional and Spiritual
        Emptiness\n- \"In a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty
        heart there is room for nothing.\" - Antonio Porchia.\n- \"The empty mind
        - the pure mind - is not a blank, zero-land, where you''re not feeling or
        caring about anything. It''s an effulgence of the mind. It''s a brightness
        that is truly sensitive and accepting.\" - From a discussion on the empty
        mind.\n\n## On Physical and Environmental Emptiness\n- \"Every little girl
        knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she thought somebody was.\"
        - George Macdonald.\n- \"The earth was empty and bleak.\" - Jean Craighead
        George, from \"Julie of the Wolves\".\n\n## On Philosophical and Poetic Perspectives\n-
        \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life
        is unfurled.\u201d - C. S. Lewis.\n- \"By emptying their hearts And filling
        their bellies, Weakening their intelligence And toughening their sinews Ever
        striving to make the people knowledgeless and desireless.\u201d - Lao Tzu,
        from \"Tao Te Ching\".\n\n## On Everyday Life and Observations\n- \"No one
        has ever sent me a letter. Every day my mailbox is empty. That is why waiting
        for the mail is a sad time for me.\u201d - Arnold Lobel, from \"Frog and Toad
        Are Friends\".\n- \"My holes were empty like a cup, In every hole the sea
        came up Till it could come no more\u201d - Robert Louis Stevenson, from \"A
        Child''s Garden of Verses\".\n\nThese quotes capture various aspects of emptiness,
        ranging from emotional and spiritual states to physical environments and philosophical
        reflections."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
