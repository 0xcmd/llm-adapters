        you are looking for quotes that reflect various perspectives on the concept
        of \"empty\" or \"emptiness,\" here are some noteworthy examples:\n\n## Philosophical
        and Spiritual Emptiness\n- \"The empty mind - the pure mind - is not a blank,
        zero-land, where you''re not feeling or caring about anything. It''s an effulgence
        of the mind. It''s a brightness that is truly sensitive and accepting. It''s
        an ability to accept life as it is.\"\n- \"Empty is the perfect state of being.
        Nothing inside to anchor you. Nothing inside to chain you down, keep you from
        living your dreams. Empty, almost weightless, you are an eyelash afloat on
        a blink of breeze.\"\n\n## Emotional and Psychological Emptiness\n- \"If emptiness
        is empty, how can something be borne or awaken from it?\" - Dejan Stojanovic\n-
        \"They say you don\u2019t get over someone until you find someone or something
        better. As humans, we don\u2019t deal well with emptiness. Any empty space
        must be filled. Immediately. The pain of emptiness is too strong.\"\n\n##
        Literary and Poetic Emptiness\n- \"Into the void of silence, into the empty
        space of nothing, the joy of life is unfurled.\" - C.S. Lewis\n- \"Every little
        girl knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she thought somebody
        was.\" - George Macdonald\n\n## Practical and Everyday Emptiness\n- \"No one
        has ever sent me a letter. Every day my mailbox is empty. That is why waiting
        for the mail is a sad time for me.\" - Arnold Lobel\n- \"When an empty person
        sits on an empty chair, the chair will still remain empty!\" - Mehmet Murat
        ildan\n\n## Humorous Perspective on Emptiness (Empty Nest Syndrome)\n- \"Hey
        empty nest parents, if you want your kid to call you, just change your Netflix
        password.\" - Unknown\n- \"If the nest is truly empty, who owns all this junk?\"
        - Erma Bombeck\n\nThese quotes cover a wide range of themes, from the philosophical
        and spiritual to the emotional, literary, and humorous."}, "delta": {"role":
