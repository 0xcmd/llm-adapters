        you are looking for quotes that reflect the concept of emptiness, here are
        some poignant and thought-provoking examples:\n\n## On Emptiness and Growth\n-
        \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the joy of life
        is unfurled.\u201d - C. S. Lewis.\n\n## On Emotional Emptiness\n- \"Every
        little girl knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she thought
        somebody was.\u201d - George Macdonald.\n- \"No one has ever sent me a letter.
        Every day my mailbox is empty. That is why waiting for the mail is a sad time
        for me.\u201d - Arnold Lobel.\n\n## On Spiritual and Philosophical Emptiness\n-
        \"The empty mind - the pure mind - is not a blank, zero-land, where you''re
        not feeling or caring about anything. It''s an effulgence of the mind. It''s
        a brightness that is truly sensitive and accepting.\u201d - From a description
        of the Taoist perspective.\n\n## On Finding Fulfillment\n- \"Feeling empty
        is the invitation to refill your soul with whatever brings you joy and a sense
        of purpose.\u201d.\n\n## On the Contrast Between Fullness and Emptiness\n-
        \"In a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty heart there
        is room for nothing.\u201d - Antonio Porchia.\n\n## On Personal Struggle and
        Emptiness\n- \"I feel like a ghost in a world of paper dolls. I am the ghost
        in my own machine... I am a ghost running through time and space, looking,
        always looking in the blackness for a sacred spark.\u201d This quote highlights
        a deep sense of emptiness and disconnection.\n\nThese quotes capture various
        aspects of emptiness, ranging from emotional and spiritual to philosophical
        and personal."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
