        you are looking for quotes that address the concept of an \"empty nest,\"
        particularly in the context of parents whose children have left home, here
        are some insightful and varied quotes:\n\n## Funny Quotes\n- \"Hey empty nest
        parents, if you want your kid to call you, just change your Netflix password.\"
        - Unknown.\n- \"When mothers talk about the depression of the empty nest,
        they\u2019re not mourning the passing of all those wet towels on the floor,
        or the music that numbs your teeth, or even the bottle of capless shampoo
        dribbling down the shower drain. They\u2019re upset because they\u2019ve gone
        from supervisor of a child\u2019s life to a spectator. It\u2019s like being
        the vice president of the United States.\u201d - Erma Bombeck.\n- \"I don\u2019t
        like the term empty nesters. I prefer \u2018parents of free range adults\u2019.\u201d
        - Robin Fox.\n\n## Comforting Quotes\n- \"I think that the best thing we can
        do for our children is to allow them to do things for themselves, allow them
        to be strong, allow them to experience life on their own terms, allow them
        to take the subway...let them be better people, let them believe more in themselves.\u201d
        - C. JoyBell C..\n- \"Our children\u2019s independence is a reminder of how
        much we had to give and all that we have accomplished. It is a pleasure to
        remember that it is not a form of abandonment but an expression of a job well
        done.\u201d - Unknown.\n\n## Inspiring Quotes\n- \"Give the ones you love
        wings to fly, roots to come back, reasons to stay.\u201d - Dalai Lama.\n-
        \"It''s not only children who grow. Parents do too. As much as we watch to
        see what our children do with their lives, they are watching us to see what
        we do with ours. I can\u2019t tell my children to reach for the sun. All I
        can do is reach for it myself.\" - Joyce Maynard.\n\n## Sad but Heartwarming
        Quotes\n- \"As a parent, you quickly realize that life is one long series
        of letting go: watching your kid crawl, then walk, then run, and then drive
        away.\u201d - Deborah Mitchell.\n- \"There are two times when parenting is
        the most difficult. When the baby first arrives at home, and when the adult
        first leaves the home.\u201d - Jennifer Quinn.\n\nThese quotes capture the
        various emotions and perspectives associated with the empty nest syndrome,
        from humor and comfort to inspiration and the bittersweet nature of letting
        go."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
