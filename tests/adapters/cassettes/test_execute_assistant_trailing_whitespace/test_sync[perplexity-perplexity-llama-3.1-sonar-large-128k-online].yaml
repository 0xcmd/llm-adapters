        are some insightful and varied quotes about the concept of \"empty\" from
        different contexts:\n\n## Emotional and Philosophical Perspectives\n\n- **C.
        S. Lewis**: \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing, the
        joy of life is unfurled.\"\n- **Lao Tzu**: \"By emptying their hearts And
        filling their bellies, Weakening their intelligence And toughening their sinews
        Ever striving to make the people knowledgeless and desireless.\"\n- **Antonio
        Porchia**: \"In a full heart there is room for everything, and in an empty
        heart there is room for nothing.\"\n\n## Literary and Narrative Contexts\n\n-
        **Neil Gaiman**: \"All alone, in the middle of the night, Coraline began to
        cry. There was no other sound in the empty flat.\"\n- **Laurie Halse Anderson**:
        \"This closet is abandoned - it has no purpose, no name. It is the perfect
        place for me.\"\n- **George Macdonald**: \"Every little girl knows how dreadful
        it is to find a room empty where she thought somebody was.\"\n\n## Psychological
        and Reflective Insights\n\n- **Waylon H. Lewis**: \"I am a lover of love and
        I am a lover of words, and the two together spin visions of airy castles,
        but also may pierce the heart of hope. And so I remind you that I am a fool,
        a poet, and what matters is reality, not lovely words. Words are full of promise,
        yet empty of matter.\"\n- **Arnold Lobel**: \"No one has ever sent me a letter.
        Every day my mailbox is empty. That is why waiting for the mail is a sad time
        for me.\"\n\n## Humorous and Relatable Quotes on Empty Nest Syndrome\n\n-
        **Erma Bombeck**: \"When mothers talk about the depression of the empty nest,
        they\u2019re not mourning the passing of all those wet towels on the floor,
        or the music that numbs your teeth, or even the bottle of capless shampoo
        dribbling down the shower drain. They\u2019re upset because they\u2019ve gone
        from supervisor of a child\u2019s life to a spectator.\"\n- **Robin Fox**:
        \"I don\u2019t like the term empty nesters. I prefer \u2018parents of free
        range adults\u2019.\"\n- **Unknown**: \"Hey empty nest parents, if you want
        your kid to call you, just change your Netflix password.\"\n\nThese quotes
        capture various aspects of the concept of \"empty,\" ranging from philosophical
        reflections to emotional and humorous observations."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
