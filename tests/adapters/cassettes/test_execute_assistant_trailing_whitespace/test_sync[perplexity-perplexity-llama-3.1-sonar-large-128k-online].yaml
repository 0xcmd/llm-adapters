        you are looking for quotes related to the concept of \"empty\" or \"emptiness,\"
        here are some diverse and meaningful options from various sources:\n\n## Empty
        Nest Syndrome\nFor those dealing with the emotional aspects of children leaving

        parents, if you want your kid to call you, just change your Netflix password.\"
        - Unknown.\n- **Inspirational**: \"Give the ones you love wings to fly, roots
        to come back, reasons to stay.\" - Dalai Lama.\n- **Comforting**: \"Our children\u2019s
        independence is a reminder of how much we had to give and all that we have
        accomplished. It is a pleasure to remember that it is not a form of abandonment
        but an expression of a job well done.\" - Unknown.\n\n## General Concepts
        of Emptiness\nHere are some quotes that explore the broader idea of emptiness:\n\n-
        **Philosophical**: \"Into the void of silence, into the empty space of nothing,
        the joy of life is unfurled.\" - C.S. Lewis.\n- **Spiritual**: \"Empty your
        mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings,
        but contemplate their return.\" - From the Tao Te Ching.\n- **Literary**:
        \"Every little girl knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she
        thought somebody was.\" - George Macdonald.\n\n## Emotional and Psychological
        Aspects\nThese quotes delve into the emotional and psychological aspects of
        emptiness:\n\n- **Reflective**: \"In a full heart there is room for everything,
        and in an empty heart there is room for nothing.\" - Antonio Porchia.\n- **Poetic**:
        \"I am a lover of love and I am a lover of words, and the two together spin
        visions of airy castles, but also may pierce the heart of hope. And so I remind
        you that I am a fool, a poet, and what matters is reality, not lovely words.
        Words are full of promise, yet empty of matter.\" - Waylon H. Lewis.\n\nThese
        quotes offer a range of perspectives on what it means to be empty, whether
        it''s the physical absence of something, the emotional state of emptiness,
        or the philosophical and spiritual interpretations."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant",
