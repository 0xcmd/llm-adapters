        an AI text-based model, I don''t have the capability to generate real-time
        data or use external tools. However, I can simulate a random number within
        the range of 1 to 10 by using a simple random number generation algorithm.
        Please note that this is not truly random as it''s determined by an algorithm
        at the time of this response.\n\nHere''s a simulated random number for you:
        7\n\nIf you need a truly random number, you should use a random number generator

        in Python, or any online random number generator.","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1732154208,"id":"202411210956441c1b701346034ea5","model":"glm-4-air","request_id":"202411210956441c1b701346034ea5","usage":{"completion_tokens":129,"prompt_tokens":16,"total_tokens":145}}'
