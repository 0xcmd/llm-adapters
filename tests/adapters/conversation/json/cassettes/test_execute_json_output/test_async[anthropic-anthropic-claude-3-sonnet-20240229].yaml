        JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format
        that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse
        and generate. It is often used for transmitting data between a server and
        web application, as an alternative to XML.\n\nHere''s an example of a JSON
        object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"person\": {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\":
        32,\n    \"city\": \"New York\",\n    \"skills\": [\"JavaScript\", \"React\",
        \"Node.js\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a JSON object with a
        single key-value pair. The key is \"person\", and the value is another object
        with keys like \"name\", \"age\", \"city\", and \"skills\". The \"skills\"
        key has an array as its value, containing various programming languages and
        frameworks.\n\nYou can also represent arrays in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\":
        1,\n    \"name\": \"Product 1\",\n    \"price\": 19.99\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\":
        2,\n    \"name\": \"Product 2\",\n    \"price\": 24.99\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\":
        3,\n    \"name\": \"Product 3\",\n    \"price\": 15.99\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis
        is an array of objects, where each object represents a product with an id,
        name, and price.\n\nJSON is widely used in modern web development for data
        exchange between the client and server, as well as for storing and transmitting
        structured data. Many programming languages and frameworks provide built-in
        support for working with JSON data."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":11,"output_tokens":383}}'
