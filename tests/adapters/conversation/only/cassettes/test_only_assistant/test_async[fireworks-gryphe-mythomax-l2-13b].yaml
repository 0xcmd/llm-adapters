        \nThanks for the question. Unfortunately, I''m not familiar with any specific
        resources or books about using virtual reality for photography, but I can
        provide some general information about virtual reality and photography.\nVirtual
        reality (VR) technology has been making strides in various industries, including
        travel and tourism, gaming, and real estate. In terms of photography, VR can
        be used to create immersive experiences that allow viewers to feel like they
        are physically present in a scene. This can be achieved through 360-degree
        images or videos that are viewed through a VR headset.\nSome camera manufacturers,
        such as Nikon and Samsung, have already introduced cameras with built-in VR
        capabilities, which allow users to capture and share their experiences in
        a more interactive way. Additionally, specialized software and platforms like
        Google Photos and Facebook''s 360-degree photos feature allow users to upload
        and view 360-degree images and videos.\nIf you''re interested in learning
        more about VR for photography, you may want to explore some of these platforms
        and tools, as well as look for online tutorials or resources specifically
        geared towards using VR for photography."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":9,"total_tokens":277,"completion_tokens":268}}'
