        1: Understanding the problem and given information\n\nWe are given a triangle
        with vertices A(2, -3), B(-4, 5) and C(0, 6). We need to find the area of
        this triangle.\n\nStep 2: Finding the lengths of the sides of the triangle\n\nTo
        calculate the area of a triangle, we first need to find the lengths of its
        sides. Let''s denote the side opposite vertex A as BC, the side opposite vertex
        B as CA, and the side opposite vertex C as AB.\n\nUsing the distance formula,
        we can find the length of each side:\n- The length of side BC is calculated
        using the coordinates of points B and C.\n   BC = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 -
        y1)^2)\n      = sqrt((-4 - 0)^2 + (5 - 6)^2)\n      = sqrt(16 + 1)\n      =
        sqrt(17)\n\n- Similarly, the length of side CA is calculated using the coordinates
        of points C and A.\n   CA = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n      = sqrt((0
        - 2)^2 + (6 - (-3))^2)\n      = sqrt(4 + 81)\n      = sqrt(85)\n\n- Finally,
        the length of side AB is calculated using the coordinates of points A and
        B.\n   AB = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n      = sqrt((-4 - 2)^2 + (5
        - (-3))^2)\n      = sqrt(36 + 64)\n      = sqrt(100)\n      = 10\n\nSo, the
        lengths of the sides of the triangle are BC = sqrt(17), CA = sqrt(85), and
        AB = 10.\n\nStep 3: Calculating the semi-perimeter of the triangle\n\nThe
        semi-perimeter of a triangle is half the sum of its side lengths. In this
        case, it would be:\ns = (BC + CA + AB)/2\n  = (sqrt(17) + sqrt(85) + 10)/2\n\nStep
        4: Using Heron''s formula to find the area of the triangle\n\nHeron''s formula
        states that the area of a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c is given
        by:\nArea = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n\nSubstituting the values
        we have found into the formula:\nArea = sqrt(((sqrt(17) + sqrt(85) + 10)/2)
        * (((sqrt(17) + sqrt(85) + 10)/2) - sqrt(17)) * (((sqrt(17) + sqrt(85) + 10)/2)
        - sqrt(85)) * (((sqrt(17) + sqrt(85) + 10)/2) - 10))\n\nSimplifying the expression
        gives us the final answer for the area of the triangle.","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1732153545,"id":"20241121094526a1b9c242aed04abe","model":"glm-4v-plus","request_id":"20241121094526a1b9c242aed04abe","usage":{"completion_tokens":628,"prompt_tokens":11,"total_tokens":639}}'
