        1: Understanding the problem statement\nThe problem states that there are
        two types of people in a population, A and B. The probability of person A
        being infected is given as P(A) = 0.2, and the probability of person B being
        infected is given as P(B) = 0.3.\n\nStep 2: Finding the probability of both
        A and B being infected\nTo find the probability of both A and B being infected,
        we need to multiply their individual probabilities together. So, P(A and B)
        = P(A) * P(B).\n\nGiven:\nP(A) = 0.2\nP(B) = 0.3\n\nTherefore,\nP(A and B)
        = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06\n\nSo, the correct answer is option (c), which represents
        6%.","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1732605820,"id":"202411261523353869fa0846634ae7","model":"glm-4v-plus","request_id":"202411261523353869fa0846634ae7","usage":{"completion_tokens":178,"prompt_tokens":11,"total_tokens":189}}'
