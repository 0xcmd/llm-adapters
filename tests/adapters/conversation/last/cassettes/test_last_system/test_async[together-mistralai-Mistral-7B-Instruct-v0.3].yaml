        that you're having trouble with your computer. Here are a few steps you can
        try to troubleshoot the issue:\\n\\n1. Check for any hardware issues: Make
        sure that all of your hardware components, such as the RAM, hard drive, and
        power supply, are properly seated and functioning correctly.\\n2. Update your
        drivers: Make sure that your drivers are up to date. You can do this by going
        to the manufacturer's website and downloading the latest drivers for your
        hardware.\\n3. Run a virus scan: Run a virus scan to make sure that your computer
        is not infected with malware.\\n4. Check for overheating: Make sure that your
        computer is not overheating. You can do this by checking the temperature of
        your CPU and GPU using a program like HWMonitor.\\n5. Check for software conflicts:
        Make sure that you don't have any software conflicts that could be causing
        the issue. You can do this by disabling any unnecessary startup programs and
        running your computer in safe mode.\\n6. Perform a system restore: If all
        else fails, you can try performing a system restore to a point before the
        issue started.\\n\\nIf none of these steps help, it may be a good idea to
        take your computer to a professional for further diagnosis.\",\n        \"tool_calls\":
