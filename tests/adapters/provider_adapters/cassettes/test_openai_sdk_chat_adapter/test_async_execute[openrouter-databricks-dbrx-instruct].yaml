        patched version:\\nOnce upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a
        tiny village nestled in a valley. This village was so small that it only had
        one street, and on that street there was just one bakery, one blacksmith,
        and one small, cozy inn.\\n\\nIn this inn lived an old woman named Agnes.
        Agnes had lived in the inn for as long as anyone could remember, and she was
        known far and wide for her kind heart and her delicious cooking. Everyone
        in the village loved Agnes, and she loved them right back.\\n\\nBut there
        was one thing that Agnes loved more than anything else in the world, and that
        was her garden. She spent every spare moment tending to her flowers and vegetables,
        and her garden was the most beautiful in the whole valley.\\n\\nOne day, as
        Agnes was working in her garden, she heard a faint rustling in the bushes.
        She looked up and saw a tiny, wrinkled old man peering out at her. He was
        so small that he could have fit in the palm of her hand.\\n\\n\\\"Hello there,\\\"
        Agnes said, smiling at the little man. \\\"Who are you, and where did you
        come from?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am a leprechaun,\\\" the little man replied, stepping
        out from the bushes. \\\"And I have come from the end of the rainbow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A
        leprechaun?\\\" Agnes said, her eyes wide with wonder. \\\"I've never seen
        a leprechaun before! What brings you to my garden?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have heard
        that you have the most beautiful garden in the whole valley,\\\" the leprechaun
        said. \\\"And I have come to see it for myself.\\\"\\n\\nAgnes beamed with
        pride. \\\"Why thank you, kind sir! I do work very hard on my garden. Would
        you like to come in and have a look around?\\\"\\n\\nThe leprechaun nodded,
        and Agnes led him through the garden, showing him all of her favorite flowers
        and vegetables. The leprechaun was fascinated by everything he saw, and he
        couldn't stop exclaiming about how beautiful and well-tended the garden was.\\n\\nAs
        they were walking through the garden, Agnes's foot caught on a rock and she
        stumbled. She reached out to steady herself, and her hand landed on a small,
        hidden door in the ground.\\n\\n\\\"What's this?\\\" Agnes said, opening the
        door to reveal a small, dark space. \\\"I've never seen this before!\\\"\\n\\nThe
        leprechaun's eyes widened with excitement. \\\"It's a leprechaun's pot of
        gold!\\\" he exclaimed. \\\"I hid it here many years ago, and I thought I
        would never find it again!\\\"\\n\\nAgnes gasped. \\\"A pot of gold? But why
        would you hide it here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was being chased by a group of angry
        villagers,\\\" the leprechaun explained. \\\"They were after my gold, and
        I needed a safe place to hide it. I stumbled upon your garden and thought
        it would be the perfect hiding spot. But then I was captured and taken away,
        and I never had the chance to come back and retrieve my gold.\\\"\\n\\nAgnes
        looked at the leprechaun, her heart filled with compassion. \\\"Well, that's
        terrible! I'm so sorry that happened to you. But I'm glad you've finally found
        your gold. Do you want me to help you take it out of the ground?\\\"\\n\\nThe
        leprechaun nodded, and Agnes carefully lifted the heavy pot of gold out of
        the ground. The leprechaun's eyes sparkled with joy as he held the pot in
        his arms.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, Agnes,\\\" the leprechaun said, his voice filled
        with gratitude. \\\"You are a kind and generous woman, and I will never forget
        what you have done for me.\\\"\\n\\nAnd with that, the leprechaun disappeared,
        leaving Agnes alone in her garden with the pot of gold.\\n\\nAgnes looked
        at the gold, her mind racing with all the things she could do with it. But
        then she thought of the leprechaun, and the joy in his eyes when he had seen
        his long-lost gold. And she knew that she couldn't keep it for herself.\\n\\nSo
        Agnes took the pot of gold to the village, and she shared it with all of her
        friends and neighbors. They used the gold to build a new school, a new hospital,
        and a new community center. And Agnes was hailed as a hero, for her kindness
        and generosity had transformed the entire valley.\\n\\nAnd Agnes lived happily
        ever after, surrounded by the people she loved and the beautiful garden that
        had brought her so much joy.\\n\\nThe end.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":16,\"completion_tokens\":961,\"total_tokens\":977,\"total_cost\":0.0005862}}"
