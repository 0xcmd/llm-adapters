        3.1. (Contd.)### Participants\\n\\nA total of 40 aphasic patients, all native
        speakers of Finnish, were recruited from the Turku University Hospital Neurology
        outpatient rehabilitation clinic. All participants were right-handed and had
        no known vision or motor deficits that might affect their performance on a
        written sentence-reading task. A group of 20 neurologically healthy and age-matched
        controls were also recruited (Table 2).\\n\\nPatients were examined and diagnosed
        at the neurology clinic by a neurologist, and diagnoses were confirmed by
        patient records and interviews, as well as CT and/or MRI brain imaging results
        when available. All patients underwent a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological
        tests in order to determine their cognitive profile. The neuropsychological
        examination was conducted by the first author after treatment had finished,
        and was unrelated to the diagnosis and/or treatment of aphasia. All patients
        had received extensive speech therapy and reported that they could cope with
        their everyday communicative needs and situations. Some of the participants
        had received therapy in the form of text reading, or had been specifically
        instructed to read, at the outpatient clinic. None of the participants had
        received intensive therapy with orthographic (morpheme) units, and this form
        of therapy is not extensively used to rehabilitate aphasia in Finland.\\n\\nAll
        participants were interviewed to determine their basic demographic characteristics
        (age, gender, handedness, education level), their use of the Finnish language,
        their medical history, and previous rehabilitation (including any specifically
        for aphasia). For aphasic participants, the presence of general aphasic symptoms
        was also assessed.\\n\\nThe 40 patients diagnosed with aphasia were classified
        into 4 subgroups: (a) Broca's (agrammatic) nonfluent aphasia, (\\\\(n=7\\\\)),
        (b) Wernicke's (anomic) fluent aphasia, (\\\\(n=10\\\\)); (c) conduction aphasia,
        (\\\\(n=6\\\\)); and (d) global aphasia, (\\\\(n=17\\\\)). The two agrammatic
        groups (Broca's and global aphasia) were combined into one group because,
        while they were not homogenous with respect to the severity of their language

        2: Participant characteristicsinvolvement in the various modalities (Vuorinen
        _et al._, 2002), a larger proportion had syntactic, morphological, lexical-semantic,
        and/or reading deficits that primarily affected their receptive language abilities
        (Caramazza and Berndt, 1985). The conduction aphasics, as a group, were distinguished
        from the Broca's (agrammatic) aphasics, because they did not show the phonological
        parsing deficits observed in their agrammatic counterparts (Blumstein _et
        al._, 1982). The conduction aphasics typically had deficits at the level of
        articulatory motor control and memory (Geschwind and Fusillo, 1966). The Wernicke's
        (anomic) fluent aphasics had predominantly lexical-semantic deficits, although,
        because of difficulties with lexical access and retrieval, the patient frequently
        uses syntactically simple and semantically empty circumlocutory expressions
        (Warburton _et al._, 1999).\\n\\nAll patients had been diagnosed with ischemic
        cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), predominantly to the left hemisphere (Table
        2), and all but four had lesions to the perisylvian areas or to the deeper
        hemispheric structures.\\n\\nTwo neurologically healthy control (HC) groups
        (\\\\(n=20\\\\)) were also recruited (\\\\(n=10\\\\)) or were age-matched
        (\\\\(n=10\\\\)) to the 4 aphasia groups. There were no differences between
        the aphasic groups and the healthy control groups with respect to demographic
        characteristics, and an analysis of variance \\\\(\\\\langle\\\\)ANOVA\\\\(\\\\rangle\\\\)
        revealed no group differences in terms of number of years of formal education
        (Table 2).\\n\\n### Procedure\\n\\nThe test design consisted of three main
        parts: screening measures, sentence-reading task, and post-tasks. Sentence
        stimuli consisted of 20 sentences and were selected from a larger, more comprehensive
        sentence set compiled by Hakulinen (1998) for a study on language decline
        in older adults (Table 1). This particular sentence set was selected because:
        (a) it was constructed to reveal deficits in written language comprehension
        and use; (b) it included a fairly even distribution of syntactically complex
        and simple sentence types; \\\\(\\\\langle\\\\)c\\\\(\\\\rangle\\\\) it was
        of a suitable length and reading difficulty for brain-damaged patients; and
        (d) it was a naturally representative sample of spoken and written discourse.
